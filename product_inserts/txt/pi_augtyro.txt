5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions
AUGTYRO can cause central nervous system adverse reactions.
Among the 426 patients who received AUGTYRO in Study TRIDENT-1, a broad spectrum 
of central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions including dizziness, ataxia, and 
cognitive disorders occurred in 77% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 events occurring in 
4.5% of patients.
Dizziness, including vertigo, occurred in 65% of patients; Grade 3 dizziness occurred 
in 2.8% of patients. The median time to onset was 7 days (1 day to 1.4 years). Dose 
interruption was required in 9% of patients, and 11% required dose reduction of 
AUGTYRO due to dizziness.
Ataxia, including gait disturbance and balance disorder, occurred in 28% of patients; 
Grade 3 ataxia occurred in 0.5% of patients. The median time to onset was 15 days 
(1 day to 1.4 years). Dose interruption was required in 5% of patients, 8% required dose 
reduction, and one patient (0.2%) permanently discontinued AUGTYRO due to ataxia.
Cognitive impairment, including memory impairment and disturbance in attention, 
occurred in 25% of patients. Cognitive impairment included memory impairment (15%), 
disturbance in attention (12%), and confusional state (2%); Grade 3 cognitive impairment 
occurred in 0.9% of patients. The median time to onset of cognitive disorders was 37 days 
(1 day to 1.4 years). Dose interruption was required in 2% of patients, 2.1% required  
dose reduction, and 0.5% patients permanently discontinued AUGTYRO due to cognitive 
adverse reactions.
Mood disorders occurred in 6% of patients. Mood disorders occurring in >1% of patients 
included anxiety (2.6%); Grade 4 mood disorders (mania) occurred in 0.2% of patients. 
Dose interruption was required in 0.2% of patients and 0.2% of patients required a dose 
reduction due to mood disorders.
Sleep disorders including insomnia and hypersomnia occurred in 18% of patients. Sleep 
disorders observed in >1% of patients were somnolence (9%), insomnia (6%) and 
hypersomnia (1.6%). Dose interruption was required in 0.7% of patients, and 0.2% of 
patients required a dose reduction due to sleep disorders.
The incidences of CNS adverse reactions observed were similar in patients with and 
without CNS metastases.
Advise patients and caregivers of the risk of CNS adverse reactions with AUGTYRO. 
Advise patients not to drive or use machines if they are experiencing CNS adverse 
reactions. Withhold and then resume at same or reduced dose upon improvement, 
or permanently discontinue AUGTYRO based on severity [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.5)].
5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis
AUGTYRO can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis.
Among the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, ILD/pneumonitis (pneumonitis [2.8%] 
and ILD [0.2%]) occurred in 3.1% of patients; Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 
1.2% of patients. The median time to onset was 45 days (19 days to 0.9 years). Dose 
interruption was required in 1.4% of patients, 0.5% of patients required dose reduction, 
and 1.1% of patients permanently discontinued AUGTYRO due to ILD/pneumonitis.
Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis.  
Immediately withhold AUGTYRO in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and 
permanently discontinue AUGTYRO if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.5)].
5.3 Hepatotoxicity
AUGTYRO can cause hepatotoxicity.
Among the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, increased alanine transaminase (ALT) 
occurred in 38%, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 41%, including Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT in 3.3% and increased AST in 2.9%. The median time to 
onset of increased ALT or AST was 15 days (range: 1 day to 1.9 years). Increased ALT or 
AST leading to dose interruptions or reductions occurred in 2.8% and 1.2% of patients, 
respectively. Hyperbilirubinemia leading to dose interruptions occurred in 0.5%.
Monitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST and bilirubin, every 2 weeks during the 
first month of treatment, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold 
and then resume at the same or reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently 
discontinue AUGTYRO based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
5.4 Myalgia with Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation
AUGTYRO can cause myalgia with or without creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation.
Among the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, myalgia occurred in 13% of patients, with 
Grade 3 in 0.7%. Median time to onset of myalgia was 19 days (range: 1 day to 2 years).  
Concurrent increased CPK within a 7-day window was observed in 3.7% of patients. 
AUGTYRO was interrupted in one patient with myalgia and concurrent CPK elevation.
Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness.
Monitor serum CPK levels during AUGTYRO treatment and monitor CPK levels every 
2 weeks during the first month of treatment and as needed in patients reporting 
unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Initiate supportive care as clinically 
indicated. Based on severity, withhold and then resume AUGTYRO at the same or 
reduced dose upon improvement [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
5.5 Hyperuricemia
AUGTYRO can cause hyperuricemia.
Among the 426 patients treated with AUGTYRO, 21 patients (5%) experienced hyperuricemia  
reported as an adverse reaction and 0.7% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 
hyperuricemia. One patient without pre-existing gout required urate-lowering medication.
Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to initiating AUGTYRO and periodically during 
treatment. Initiate treatment with urate-lowering medications as clinically indicated. 
Withhold and then resume at the same or reduced dose upon improvement, or  
permanently discontinue AUGTYRO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
5.6 Skeletal Fractures
AUGTYRO can cause skeletal fractures.
Among 426 adult patients who received AUGTYRO, fractures occurred in 2.3%. Fractures 
involved the ribs (0.5%), feet (0.5%), spine (0.2%), acetabulum (0.2%), sternum (0.2%), 
and ankles (0.2%). Some fractures occurred at sites of disease and prior radiation 
therapy. The median time to fracture was 71 days (range: 31 days to 1.4 years). AUGTYRO  
was interrupted in 0.3% of patients.
Of 26 evaluable patients in an ongoing open-label study in pediatric patients, fractures 
occurred in one 12-year-old patient (ankle/foot) and one 10-year-old patient (stress 
fracture). AUGTYRO was interrupted in both patients. AUGTYRO is not approved for use in 
pediatric patients less than 12 years of age [see Pediatric Use (8.4)].
Promptly evaluate patients with signs or symptoms (e.g., pain, changes in mobility, 
deformity) of fractures. There are no data on the effects of AUGTYRO on healing of 
known fractures and risk of future fractures.
5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes 
in tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinase (TRK) signaling, findings from animal studies, 
and its mechanism of action, AUGTYRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman.
Oral administration of repotrectinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis 
resulted in fetal malformations at doses approximately 0.3 times the recommended 
160 mg twice daily dose based on body surface area (BSA).
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive 
potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with AUGTYRO 
and for 2 months following the last dose, since AUGTYRO can render some hormonal 
contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Advise male patients with female 
partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment 
with AUGTYRO and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations 
(8.1, 8.3)].

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction 
rates reported in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the 
clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
The pooled safety population described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and below 
reflects exposure to AUGTYRO in 426 patients with  ROS1-positive NSCLC (n=320), 
NTRK1/2/3 -positive solid tumors (n=104), or other solid tumors (n=2) in TRIDENT-1. 
Patients received AUGTYRO at a dose of 160 mg orally once daily for the first 14 days, 
then increased to 160 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity [see Clinical Studies (14. 1), (14.2)]. Eligible patients had an ECOG status of ≤1. 
Patients with a history of ILD, drug-related pneumonitis, significant, uncontrolled, active 
cardiovascular disease, or prolonged QTc interval were excluded from enrollment in this 
trial. Forty-eight percent of patients were exposed to AUGTYRO for at least 6 months, and 
28% were exposed for greater than 1 year.
The median age of patients who received AUGTYRO was 57 years (range: 18 to 93); 
59% female; 43% White, 47% Asian, 2.8% Black, 0.5% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific 
Islander, 0.5% American Indian or Alaska Native, 6.1% race not reported or other, and 
0.7% unknown.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients who received AUGTYRO. Serious 
adverse reactions in ≥2% of patients included pneumonia (6.3%), dyspnea (3.1%), 
pleural effusion (2.8%), and hypoxia (2.6%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.5% 
of patients who received AUGTYRO, including pneumonia, pneumonia aspiration, cardiac 
arrest, sudden cardiac death, cardiac failure, hypoxia, dyspnea, respiratory failure, tremor, 
and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Permanent discontinuation of AUGTYRO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7% of 
patients. There were no specific adverse reactions that accounted for ≥1% of permanent 
discontinuations.
Dosage interruptions of AUGTYRO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 50% of 
patients. Adverse reactions that required dosage interruption in ≥2% of patients were 
dizziness, dyspnea, muscular weakness, ataxia, pneumonia, peripheral neuropathy, 
anemia, and vomiting.
Dose reductions of AUGTYRO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 38% of patients. 
Adverse reactions that required dosage reductions in ≥2% of patients included dizziness, 
ataxia, muscular weakness, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive impairment.
The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving 
AUGTYRO were dizziness, dysgeusia, peripheral neuropathy, constipation, dyspnea, 
fatigue, ataxia, cognitive impairment, muscular weakness and nausea.

7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on AUGTYRO
Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors
Avoid concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Concomitant use 
of AUGTYRO with a strong or a moderate CYP3A inhibitor may increase repotrectinib 
exposure, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of 
AUGTYRO. Discontinue CYP3A inhibitors for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives of the CYP3A 
inhibitor prior to initiating AUGTYRO [see Clinical Pharmacolog y (12.3)].
P-gp Inhibitors
Avoid concomitant use with P-gp inhibitors. Concomitant use of AUGTYRO with a P-gp 
inhibitor may increase repotrectinib exposure, which may increase the incidence and 
severity of adverse reactions of AUGTYRO [see Clinical Pharmacolog y (12.3)].
Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers
Avoid concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. Concomitant use 
of AUGTYRO with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer may decrease repotrectinib 
plasma concentrations, which may decrease efficacy of AUGTYRO [see Clinical 
Pharmacolog y (12.3)].
7.2 Effects of AUGTYRO on Other Drugs
Certain CYP3A4 Substrates
Avoid concomitant use unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information for 
CYP3A substrates, where minimal concentration changes can cause reduced efficacy.  
If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the CYP3A4 substrate dosage in accordance 
with approved product labeling.
Repotrectinib is a CYP3A4 inducer. Concomitant use of repotrectinib decreases the 
concentration of CYP3A4 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which can 
reduce the efficacy of these substrates.
Contraceptives
Repotrectinib is a CYP3A4 inducer, which can decrease progestin or estrogen exposure 
to an extent that could reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.
Avoid concomitant use of AUGTYRO with hormonal contraceptives [see Use in Specific 
Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective 
nonhormonal contraceptive [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Risk Summary
Based on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes 
in TRK signaling, findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action [see 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], AUGTYRO can cause fetal harm when administered to 
a pregnant woman. There are no available data on AUGTYRO use in pregnant women. 
Oral administration of repotrectinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis 
resulted in fetal malformations at doses approximately 0.3 times the recommended dose 
of 160 mg twice daily based on BSA (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential 
risk to a fetus.
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and 
miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.
Data
Human Data
Published reports of individuals with congenital mutations in TRK pathway proteins 
suggest that decreases in TRK-mediated signaling are correlated with obesity, 
developmental delays, cognitive impairment, insensitivity to pain, and anhidrosis.
Animal Data
In an embryo-fetal development study, once daily oral administration of repotrectinib to 
pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis from gestation day 6 to 17 resulted 
in maternal effects of increased body weight and skin abrasions/ulcerations at doses 
≥6 mg/kg, fetal malformations of malrotated hindlimbs and lower fetal body weights at 
doses ≥12 mg/kg [approximately 0.3 times the recommended dose of 160 mg twice 
daily based on BSA]. No embryolethality was observed.
8.2 Lactation
Risk Summary
There are no data on the presence of AUGTYRO in human milk or its effects on either 
the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in breastfed children from AUGTYRO, advise a lactating woman to discontinue 
breastfeeding during treatment with AUGTYRO and for 10 days after the last dose.
8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
AUGTYRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.1)].
Pregnancy Testing
Verify the pregnancy status of females of childbearing potential prior to initiating 
AUGTYRO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].Contraception
AUGTYRO can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see 
Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Females
Advise females of childbearing potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception 
during treatment with AUGTYRO and for 2 months following the last dose. AUGTYRO can 
render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
Males
Based on genotoxicity findings, advise male patients with female partners of childbearing 
potential to use effective contraception during treatment with AUGTYRO and for 4 months 
following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicolog y (13. 1)].
8.4 Pediatric Use
The safety and effectiveness of AUGTYRO in pediatric patients with  ROS1-positive NSCLC 
have not been established.
The safety and effectiveness of AUGTYRO have not been established in pediatric patients 
younger than 12 years of age with solid tumors who have an NTRK gene fusion.
The safety and effectiveness of AUGTYRO for the treatment of locally advanced  
or metastatic NTRK -positive solid tumors have been established in pediatric patients 
12 years of age or older. Use of AUGTYRO in this age group is supported by evidence from 
an adequate and well-controlled study in adult patients with additional pharmacokinetic 
and safety data in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. This includes data 
demonstrating that the exposure of repotrectinib in pediatric patients 12 years of age 
and older is expected to result in similar safety and efficacy to that of adults, and that 
the course of locally advanced or metastatic NTRK -positive solid tumors is sufficiently 
similar in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age or older to allow extrapolation 
of data in adult to pediatric patients 12 years of age or older [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical 
Pharmacolog y (12.3)].
Juvenile Animal Data
Daily oral administration of repotrectinib to juvenile rats for 8 weeks starting on 
postnatal day 12 (approximately equal to a human pediatric age of a newborn) 
resulted in toxicities similar to those observed in adult rats, though juvenile animals 
showed decreased body weight gain at doses ≥1 mg/kg (approximately ≥0.04 times 
the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 160 mg BID) 
and decreased femur lengths at 3 mg/kg (approximately 0.1 times the human exposure 
based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 160 mg BID). Decreased body weight 
gain and decreased femur lengths persisted following 4 weeks of recovery.
8.5 Geriatric Use
Of the 426 patients who received AUGTYRO, in the TRIDENT-1 study for  ROS1-positive 
non-small cell lung cancer or NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumors, 19% were 65 to 
75 years old, and 6% were 75 years of age or older. There were no clinically meaningful 
differences in safety and efficacy between patients younger than 65 years of age 
and patients 65 years of age or older.
8.6 Renal Impairment
The recommended dosage of AUGTYRO has not been established in patients with severe 
renal impairment or kidney failure (eGFR <30 mL/min) and patients on dialysis [see 
Clinical Pharmacolog y (12.3)].
No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR 30 to 90 mL/min).
8.7 Hepatic Impairment
The recommended dosage of AUGTYRO has not been established in patients with 
moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times upper limit of normal [ULN] with any AST) 
or severe (total bilirubin >3 times ULN with any AST) hepatic impairment [see Clinical 
Pharmacolog y (12.3)].
No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild (total bilirubin >1 to 
1.5 times ULN or AST > ULN) hepatic impairment.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
Repotrectinib is an inhibitor of proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS1 (ROS1) and 
of the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRKs) TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC.
Fusion proteins that include ROS1 or TRK domains can drive tumorigenic potential 
through hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways leading to unconstrained  
cell proliferation. Repotrectinib exhibited anti-tumor activity in cultured cells 
expressing  ROS1 fusions and mutations including SDC4-ROS1, SDC4-ROS1 G2032R, 
CD74-ROS1, CD74-ROS1 G2032R, CD74-ROS1  D2033N, and CD74-ROS1 L2026M. Repotrectinib 
also inhibited cell proliferation in cultured cells expressing NTRK fusions and mutations 
including LMNA-TRKA, LMNA-TRKA G595R, EVT6-TRKB G639R, and ETV6-TRKC G623R.
12.2 Pharmacodynamics
Repotrectinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic 
responses are not fully characterized.
Cardiac Electrophysiology
AUGTYRO does not cause a mean increase in the QTc interval >20 milliseconds (ms) at 
160 mg QD followed by 160 mg BID, the approved recommended dosage.
12.3 Pharmacokinetics
The geometric mean (CV%) of repotrectinib steady state peak concentration (C max,ss ) 
is 713 (32.5%) ng/mL and the area under the time concentration curve (AUC 0-24h,ss ) is  
7210 (40.1%) ng•h/mL following the approved recommended twice daily dosage in 
patients with cancer. Repotrectinib C max and AUC 0-inf increases approximately dose 
proportional (but less than linear with estimated slopes of 0.78 and 0.70, respectively) 
over the single dose range of 40 mg to 240 mg (0.25 to 1.5 times the approved 
recommended dosage). Steady state PK was time-dependent with an autoinduction of 
CYP3A4. Steady state is achieved within 14 days of daily administration of 160 mg.
Absorption
The geometric mean (CV%) absolute bioavailability of repotrectinib is 45.7% (19.6%). 
Peak repotrectinib concentration occurred at approximately 2 to 3 hours post a single 
oral dose of 40 mg to 240 mg (0.25 to 1.5 times the approved recommended dosage) 
under fasted conditions.
Effect of Food
No clinically significant differences in repotrectinib pharmacokinetics were observed  
in patients with cancer following administration of a high-fat meal (approximately  
800-1000 calories, 50% fat).
Distribution
The geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 432 L (55.9%) in 
patients with cancer following a single 160 mg oral dose of AUGTYRO.
AUGTYRO binding to plasma protein was 95.4% in vitro . The blood-to-plasma ratio was 
0.56 in vitro.
Elimination
Repotrectinib elimination is time-dependent due to autoinduction of CYP3A4.
The repotrectinib mean terminal half-life is approximately 60.7 h for patients with cancer 
following a single dose. The steady state repotrectinib terminal half-life is approximately 
40.3 h for patients with cancer.
The geometric mean (CV%) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 15.9 L/h (45.5%) in 
patients with cancer following a single 160 mg oral dose of AUGTYRO.
Metabolism
Repotrectinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 followed by secondary glucuronidation.
Excretion
Following a single oral 160 mg dose of radiolabeled repotrectinib, 4.84% (0.56% as  
unchanged) was recovered in urine and 88.8% (50.6% unchanged) in feces.
Specific Populations
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of repotrectinib were 
observed based on age (12 to 93 years), sex, race (White 50%, Asian 38%, Black 7%),  
mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <90 mL/min), or mild hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN or AST >ULN). The effect of moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN with any AST) or severe (total bilirubin >3 x ULN with any AST) 
hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, kidney failure (eGFR <30 mL/min), or 
dialysis on repotrectinib pharmacokinetics is unknown or not fully characterized.
Drug Interaction Studies
Clinical Studies
Strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors:  Repotrectinib AUC 0-inf increased by 5.9-fold  
and C max by 1.7-fold following concomitant use with itraconazole (strong CYP3A and 
P-gp inhibitor).
Strong CYP3A and P-gp inducers:  Repotrectinib AUC 0-inf decreased by 92% and C max  
by 79% following concomitant use with rifampin (strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer).

by 48% following concomitant use in subjects who were previously administered 
160 mg repotrectinib once daily for 14 days followed by 160 mg twice daily for 7 days.
In vitro Studies
CYP Enzymes:  Repotrectinib induces CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and 
inhibits CYP3A4/5 (GI tract). Repotrectinib does not induce CYP1A2.
Other Metabolic Pathways:  Repotrectinib inhibits UGT1A1.
Transporter Systems:   Repotrectinib inhibits P-gp, BCRP , OATP1B1, and MATE2-K. 
Repotrectinib is a substrate for P-gp.
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
Carcinogenicity studies with repotrectinib were not conducted.
Repotrectinib was genotoxic in an in vitro assay in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells 
and in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay via an aneugenic mechanism 
of action. Repotrectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation 
(Ames) assay.
Dedicated fertility studies were not conducted with repotrectinib. There were no effects 
on male and female reproductive organs observed in general repeat-dose toxicology 
studies of up to 3 months in duration in rats and monkeys at any dose level tested, 
which equated to exposures of up to approximately 3 times the human exposure at the 
160 mg twice daily dose based on AUC.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
14.1  Locally Advanced or Metastatic ROS1-Positive NSCLC
The efficacy of AUGTYRO was evaluated in TRIDENT-1, a multicenter, single-arm, 
open-label, multi-cohort clinical trial (NCT03093116). Patients were required to 
have  ROS1-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, ECOG performance status ≤1,  
measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, and ≥8 months from first dose. All patients 
were assessed for CNS lesions at baseline, and patients with symptomatic brain 
metastases were excluded from the trial. Patients received AUGTYRO 160 mg orally 
once daily for 14 days, then increased to 160 mg twice daily until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor assessments were performed at least every 8 weeks. 
Identification of  ROS1 gene fusions in tumor specimens was prospectively determined 
in local laboratories using next-generation sequencing (NGS), polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) tests. All  ROS1-positive patients by  
local FISH testing required central laboratory confirmation of  ROS1 fusion using an 
analytically validated NGS test.  ROS1 fusions were identified by NGS in 51%, FISH in 26%,  
and PCR in 23%. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate 
(ORR) and duration of response (DOR) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by 
blinded independent central review (BICR). Intracranial response according to modified 
RECIST v1.1 was assessed by BICR. Tumor assessments with imaging were performed 
every 8 weeks. The efficacy populations included 71 ROS1 TKI-naïve patients who 
received up to 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy and 
56 patients who received 1 prior ROS1 TKI with no prior platinum-based chemotherapy 
or immunotherapy.
Among the 71 ROS1 TKI-naïve patients, the median age was 57 years (range: 28 to 80); 
female (60.6%); Asian (67.6%), White (25.4%), Hispanic or Latino (4.2%), Black or African 
American (1.4%); never smoked (63.4%); and ECOG performance status of 1 at baseline 
(66.2%). At baseline, 94.4% of patients had metastatic disease, 25.4% of patients had 
CNS metastases by BICR; 97.2% had adenocarcinoma; and 28.2% patients had prior 
chemotherapy consisting of platinum-based chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy for 
locally advanced or metastatic disease.
Among the 56 patients who had received 1 prior ROS1 TKI (including crizotinib [82%] 
and entrectinib [16%]) with no prior platinum-based chemotherapy or immunotherapy, 
the median age was 57 years (range: 33 – 78); female (67.9%); Asian (48.2%), White 
(44.6%), Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino (1.8% each); never smoked 
(64.3%); and ECOG performance status of 1 at baseline (67.9%). At baseline, 98.2% 
patients had metastatic disease, 42.9% with CNS metastases by BICR, and 94.6% had 
adenocarcinoma.

Among TKI-naïve patients, 8 had measurable CNS metastases at baseline as assessed 
by BICR; responses in intracranial lesions were observed in 7 of these 8 patients. 
Among the TKI pretreated patients with no prior platinum-based chemotherapy, 12 had 
measurable CNS metastases at baseline as assessed by BICR; responses in intracranial 
lesions were observed in 5 of these 12 patients.
Among the 56 ROS1 inhibitor-pretreated patients, 8 had resistance mutations 
following TKI therapy. Responses were observed in 6 of these 8 patients; responders 
included patients with solvent front ( ROS1  G2032R), gatekeeper ( ROS1 L2026M), and other 
mutations ( ROS1  S1986F/Y).
14.2 Locally Advanced or Metastatic NTRK Gene Fusion-Positive Solid Tumors
The efficacy of AUGTYRO was evaluated in TRIDENT-1 (NCT03093116), a multi-center, 
single-arm, open-label, multi-cohort clinical trial in 88 adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic NTRK gene fusion-positive (NTRK1/2/3 ) solid tumors who had 
either received a prior TKI treatment or were TKI-naïve. All patients were assessed for 
CNS lesions at baseline, and patients with symptomatic brain metastases were excluded 
from the trial. Patients received AUGTYRO 160 mg orally once daily for 14 days, then 
increased to 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks. NTRK gene fusions were identified 
prospectively using NGS in 94%, FISH in 5%, and PCR in 1%. NTRK gene fusion-positive 
tumors identified by local FISH testing required central laboratory confirmation using an 
analytically validated NGS test. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and 
DOR according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR. Intracranial response according to 
modified RECIST v1.1 was assessed by BICR.
Among the 40 TRK TKI-naïve patients, the median age was 61 years (range: 25 to 84); 
60% were female patients; race was Asian 53%, White 25%, Black or African American 
5%, and other or not reported 18%; ethnicity was Hispanic or Latino 5%, not Hispanic 
or Latino 87%, and not reported 8%; and ECOG performance status of 1 at baseline was 
55%. At baseline, 98% of patients had metastatic disease and 23% of patients had CNS 
metastases by BICR. Seventy percent (n=28) of patients received prior systemic therapy 
with a median of one prior systemic regimen, and 7.5% (n=3) received three or more 
prior systemic regimens.
Among the 48 TRK TKI-pretreated patients, the median age was 58 years (range: 20 
to 81); 48% were female patients; race was White 65%, Asian 25%, Black or African 
American 2%, and not reported 8%; ethnicity was not Hispanic or Latino 92%, and 
missing 8%; and ECOG performance status of 1 at baseline was 60%. At baseline, 96% 
of patients had metastatic disease and 25% of patients had CNS metastases by BICR. 
Seventy-seven percent (n=37) of patients received 2 or more prior systemic regimens, 
and 46% (n=22) received three or more prior systemic regimens, and 7 patients (15%) 
received 2 prior TKI therapies.

Among the 88 patients, 5 had measurable CNS metastases at baseline as assessed by 
BICR. Responses were seen in 2 (100%) TKI-naïve patients and 3 (100%) TKI-pretreated  
patients. One out of 2 TKI-naïve and 2 out of 3 TKI-pretreated patients received prior 
radiotherapy to the brain, all more than 2 months prior to study entry.
Twenty-six of the TRK TKI-pretreated patients had a resistance mutation at baseline, 
including 24 with solvent front mutations (NTRK 1G595R and NTRK3G623L/R/E/V mutations), 
one with both a solvent front mutation and a gatekeeper mutation (NTRK 1F589L), and one 
with another mutation (NTRK 1 G667C). In the 25 TKI-pretreated patients with solvent front 
mutations at baseline, ORR was 60% (95% CI: 39, 79).
