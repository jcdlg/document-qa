2.3 Dosage Modifications
No dose reduction for OPDIVO is recommended. In general, withhold OPDIVO for severe 
(Grade 3) immune-mediated adverse reactions. Permanently discontinue OPDIVO 
for life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reactions, recurrent severe 
(Grade 3) immune-mediated reactions that require systemic immunosuppressive 
treatment, or an inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone or 
equivalent per day within 12 weeks of initiating steroids.
Dosage modifications for OPDIVO or OPDIVO in combination for adverse reactions that 
require management different from these general guidelines are summarized in Table 3 
and Table 4.
When OPDIVO is administered in combination with ipilimumab, withhold or permanently 
discontinue both ipilimumab and OPDIVO for an adverse reaction meeting these dose 
modification guidelines.

2.4 Preparation and Administration
Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration. OPDIVO is a clear to opalescent, 
colorless to pale-yellow solution. Discard if cloudy, discolored, or contains extraneous 
particulate matter other than a few translucent-to-white, proteinaceous particles.  
Do not shake.
Preparation
• Withdraw the required volume of OPDIVO and transfer into an intravenous container.
• Dilute OPDIVO with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose 
Injection, USP to prepare an infusion with a final concentration ranging from 1 mg/mL 
to 10 mg/mL. The total volume of infusion must not exceed 160 mL.
• For adult and pediatric patients with body weight 40 kg or greater, do not exceed 
a total volume of infusion of 160 mL.
• For adult and pediatric patients with body weight less than 40 kg, do not exceed 
a total volume of infusion of 4 mL/kg of body weight.
• Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion. Do not shake.
• Discard partially used vials or empty vials of OPDIVO.
• The product does not contain a preservative.
• After preparation, store the diluted solution either:
• at room temperature and room light for no more than 8 hours from the time 
of preparation to end of the infusion. Discard diluted solution if not used within 
8 hours from the time of preparation; or
• under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and protected from light for no 
more than 7 days from the time of preparation to end of infusion. Discard diluted 
solution if not used within 7 days from the time of preparation.
• Do not freeze.
Administration
• Administer the infusion, after dilution, over 30 minutes through an intravenous line 
containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter (pore size of 
0.2 micrometer to 1.2 micrometer).
• Administer OPDIVO in combination with other therapeutic agents as follows:
• With ipilimumab: administer OPDIVO first followed by ipilimumab on the same day.
• With platinum-doublet chemotherapy: administer OPDIVO first followed by 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy on the same day.
• With ipilimumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy: administer OPDIVO first 
followed by ipilimumab and then platinum-doublet chemotherapy on the same day.
• With fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy: administer OPDIVO  
first followed by fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy on the 
same day.
• Use separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion.
• Flush the intravenous line at end of infusion.
• Do not co-administer other drugs through the same intravenous line.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
OPDIVO is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either 
the programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially 
breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. 
Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions 
may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions.
Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any 
organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time 
after starting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated 
adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking 
antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation 
of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies.
Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are 
essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely 
for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-
mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function 
at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated 
adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including 
infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation 
as appropriate.
Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO depending on severity [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3)]. In general, if OPDIVO requires interruption or discontinuation, 
administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) 
until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate 
corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration 
of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse 
reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.
Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily 
require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are 
discussed below.
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which is defined as requiring use 
of steroids and no clear alternate etiology. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 
blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received 
prior thoracic radiation.
OPDIVO as a Single Agent
Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO 
as a single agent, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%) 
adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 1.1% and 
withholding of OPDIVO in 0.8% of patients.
Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (61/61) of patients with pneumonitis. 
Pneumonitis resolved in 84% of the 61 patients. Of the 15 patients in whom OPDIVO 
was withheld for pneumonitis, 14 reinitiated OPDIVO after symptom improvement;  
of these, 4 (29%) had recurrence of pneumonitis.
OPDIVO with Ipilimumab
OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg:   In NSCLC, immune-mediated pneumonitis 
occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and 
Grade 2 (4%) immune-mediated pneumonitis. Four patients (0.7%) died due to 
pneumonitis. Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO 
with ipilimumab in 5% of patients and withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 3.6% 
of patients.
Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% of patients with pneumonitis. 
Pneumonitis resolved in 72% of the patients. Approximately 13% (2/16) of patients had 
recurrence of pneumonitis after reinitiation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab.
Immune-Mediated Colitis
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids 
and no clear alternate etiology. A common symptom included in the definition of colitis 
was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients 
with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-
refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.
OPDIVO as a Single Agent
Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2.9% (58/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO as a 
single agent, including Grade 3 (1.7%) and Grade 2 (1%) adverse reactions. Colitis led 
to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 0.7% and withholding of OPDIVO in 0.9% 
of patients.
Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (58/58) of patients with colitis. 
Four patients required addition of infliximab to high-dose corticosteroids. Colitis resolved in 86% of the 58 patients. Of the 18 patients in whom OPDIVO was withheld for colitis, 
16 reinitiated OPDIVO after symptom improvement; of these, 12 (75%) had recurrence 
of colitis.
OPDIVO with Ipilimumab
OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg:   Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 
25% (115/456) of patients with melanoma or HCC receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including Grade 4 (0.4%), Grade 3 (14%), and 
Grade 2 (8%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO with 
ipilimumab in 14% and withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 4.4% of patients.
Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (115/115) of patients with colitis.  
Approximately 23% of patients required addition of infliximab to high-dose 
corticosteroids. Colitis resolved in 93% of the 115 patients. Of the 20 patients in whom 
OPDIVO with ipilimumab was withheld for colitis, 16 reinitiated treatment after symptom 
improvement; of these, 9 (56%) had recurrence of colitis.
OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg:   Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 
9% (60/666) of patients with RCC or CRC receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including Grade 3 (4.4%) and Grade 2 (3.7%) adverse reactions. 
Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 3.2% and 
withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 2.7% of patients with RCC or CRC.
Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (60/60) of patients with colitis. 
Approximately 23% of patients with immune-mediated colitis required addition of 
infliximab to high-dose corticosteroids. Colitis resolved in 95% of the 60 patients. Of the  
18 patients in whom OPDIVO with ipilimumab was withheld for colitis, 16 reinitiated 
treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 10 (63%) had recurrence of colitis.
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis and Hepatotoxicity
OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring the use of 
corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology.
OPDIVO as a Single Agent
Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (35/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO as 
a single agent, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (1.3%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse 
reactions. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 0.7% and withholding 
of OPDIVO in 0.6% of patients.
Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (35/35) of patients with hepatitis. 
Two patients required the addition of mycophenolic acid to high-dose corticosteroids. 
Hepatitis resolved in 91% of the 35 patients. Of the 12 patients in whom OPDIVO was 
withheld for hepatitis, 11 reinitiated OPDIVO after symptom improvement; of these, 
9 (82%) had recurrence of hepatitis.
OPDIVO with Ipilimumab
OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg:   Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred 
in 15% (70/456) of patients with melanoma or HCC receiving OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including Grade 4 (2.4%), Grade 3 (11%), and 
Grade 2 (1.8%) adverse reactions. Immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent 
discontinuation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 8% or withholding of OPDIVO with 
ipilimumab in 3.5% of patients.
Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (70/70) of patients with hepatitis. 
Approximately 9% of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis required the addition 
mycophenolic acid to high-dose corticosteroids. Hepatitis resolved in 91% of the 
70 patients. Of the 16 patients in whom OPDIVO with ipilimumab was withheld for 
hepatitis, 14 reinitiated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 8 (57%) had 
recurrence of hepatitis.
OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg:   Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 
7% (48/666) of patients with RCC or CRC receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including Grade 4 (1.2%), Grade 3 (4.9%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) 
adverse reactions. Immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of 
OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 3.6% and withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 2.6% of 
patients with RCC or CRC.
Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (48/48) of patients with hepatitis. 
Approximately 19% of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis required addition 
of mycophenolic acid to high-dose corticosteroids. Hepatitis resolved in 88% of the 
48 patients. Of the 17 patients in whom OPDIVO with ipilimumab was withheld for 
hepatitis, 14 reinitiated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 10 (71%) had 
recurrence of hepatitis.
OPDIVO with Cabozantinib
OPDIVO in combination with cabozantinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher 
frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to OPDIVO alone. Monitor 
liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more 
frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered 
as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt OPDIVO and cabozantinib and 
consider administering corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
With the combination of OPDIVO and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or 
AST were seen in 11% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. ALT or AST >3 times 
ULN (Grade ≥2) was reported in 83 patients, of whom 23 (28%) received systemic 
corticosteroids; ALT or AST resolved to Grades 0-1 in 74 (89%). Among the 44 patients OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)with Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST who were rechallenged with either OPDIVO (n = 11) 
or cabozantinib (n = 9) administered as a single agent or with both (n = 24), recurrence of 
Grade ≥2 increased ALT or AST was observed in 2 patients receiving OPDIVO, 2 patients 
receiving cabozantinib, and 7 patients receiving both OPDIVO and cabozantinib.
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies
Adrenal Insufficiency
OPDIVO can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For grade 2 or higher 
adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement 
as clinically indicated. Withhold OPDIVO depending on severity [see Dosage and

Nervous System:  Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic 
syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barre syndrome, nerve 
paresis, autoimmune neuropathy
Ocular:  Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can 
be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including 
blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated 
adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require 
treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss
Gastrointestinal:  Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, 
gastritis, duodenitis
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue:  Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and 
associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic
Endocrine:  Hypoparathyroidism
Other (Hematologic/Immune):   Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing 
lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, 
solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection
5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions
OPDIVO can cause severe infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in <1% of  
patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with severe or life-threatening 
infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or 
moderate infusion-related reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
OPDIVO as a Single Agent
In patients who received OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion, infusion-related 
reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients.
In a trial assessing the pharmacokinetics and safety of a more rapid infusion, in 
which patients received OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion or a 30-minute 
intravenous infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 
2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of 
patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led 
to dose delay, permanent discontinuation, or withholding of OPDIVO.
OPDIVO with Ipilimumab
OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg
Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients with melanoma and in 
8% (4/49) of patients with HCC who received OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks.OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg
Infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients with RCC and 
4.2% (5/119) of patients with CRC who received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, respectively. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 
12% (37/300) of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who received OPDIVO 
3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks.
5.3 Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a 
PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute 
graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive 
disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile 
syndrome (without an identified infectious cause) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These 
complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and 
allogeneic HSCT.
Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene 
promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking 
antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.
5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, OPDIVO can cause 
fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, 
administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis 
through delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant death. Advise 
pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential 
to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for 5 months after the 
last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].
5.5 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO Is 
Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone
In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of a PD-1 
blocking antibody, including OPDIVO, to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, 
a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased 
mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking 
antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not 
recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in

single agent in 1994 patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-037, CHECKMATE-017, 
CHECKMATE-057, CHECKMATE-066, CHECKMATE-025, CHECKMATE-067, 
CHECKMATE-205, CHECKMATE-039 or a single-arm trial in NSCLC (n = 117); OPDIVO 
1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-067 (n = 313), 
CHECKMATE-040 (n = 49), or another randomized trial (n = 94); OPDIVO 3 mg/kg 
administered with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 666) in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-214 
or CHECKMATE-142; OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
every 6 weeks in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-227 (n = 576) or CHECKMATE-743 
(n = 300); OPDIVO 360 mg with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA (n = 361); and OPDIVO 240 mg with cabozantinib 
40 mg in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-9ER (n = 320).
Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
Previously Treated Metastatic Melanoma
The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-037, a randomized, open-label trial 
in 370 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 
Patients had documented disease progression following treatment with ipilimumab 
and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The trial excluded patients with 
autoimmune disease, prior ipilimumab-related Grade 4 adverse reactions (except 
for endocrinopathies) or Grade 3 ipilimumab-related adverse reactions that had not 
resolved or were inadequately controlled within 12 weeks of the initiating event, patients 
with a condition requiring chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids (>10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications, a positive test 
for hepatitis B or C, and a history of HIV. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by 
intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n  = 268) or investigator’s choice 
of chemotherapy (n = 102): dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks or 
carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. 
The median duration of exposure was 5.3 months (range: 1 day to 13.8 + months) in  OPDIVO-treated patients and was 2 months (range: 1 day to 9.6 + months) in 
chemotherapy-treated patients. In this ongoing trial, 24% of patients received OPDIVO 
for >6 months and 3% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year.
The population characteristics in the OPDIVO group and the chemotherapy group were 
similar: 66% male, median age 59.5 years, 98% White, baseline Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 (59%) or 1 (41%), 74% with M1c stage 
disease, 73% with cutaneous melanoma, 11% with mucosal melanoma, 73% received 
two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease, and 18% had brain 
metastasis. There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline (51% vs. 38%).
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. OPDIVO was 
discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of patients. Twenty-six percent of patients 
receiving OPDIVO had a dose interruption for an adverse reaction. Grade 3 and 4 adverse 
reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 
and 4 adverse reactions reported in 2% to <5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were 
abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased 
lipase. The most common adverse reaction (reported in ≥20% of patients) was rash.

CHECKMATE-066
The safety of OPDIVO was also evaluated in CHECKMATE-066, a randomized, double-
blind, active-controlled trial in 411 previously untreated patients with BRAF V600 
wild-type unresectable or metastatic melanoma [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The 
trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease and patients requiring chronic 
systemic treatment with corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other 
immunosuppressive medications. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous 
infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n = 206) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 
intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 205). The median duration of exposure was 6.5 months 
(range: 1 day to 16.6 months) in OPDIVO-treated patients. In this trial, 47% of patients 
received OPDIVO for >6 months and 12% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year.
The trial population characteristics in the OPDIVO group and dacarbazine group:  
59% male, median age 65 years, 99.5% White, 61% with M1c stage disease,  
74% with cutaneous melanoma, 11% with mucosal melanoma, 4% with brain 
metastasis, and 37% with elevated LDH at baseline. There were more patients in the 
OPDIVO group with ECOG performance status 0 (71% vs. 59%).
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Adverse 
reactions led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 7% of patients and dose 
interruption in 26% of patients; no single type of adverse reaction accounted for the 
majority of OPDIVO discontinuations. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in  
41% of patients receiving OPDIVO.
The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients

CHECKMATE-067
The safety of OPDIVO, administered with ipilimumab or as a single agent, was evaluated 
in CHECKMATE-067, a randomized (1:1:1), double-blind trial in 937 patients with 
previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 
The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition requiring 
systemic treatment with corticosteroids (more than 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) 
or other immunosuppressive medication within 14 days of the start of study therapy, a 
positive test result for hepatitis B or C, or a history of HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive:
• OPDIVO 1 mg/kg over 60 minutes with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion 
every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by OPDIVO as a single agent at a dose of 
3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (OPDIVO and 
ipilimumab arm; n=313), or
• OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (OPDIVO arm;  
n=313), or
• Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses 
(ipilimumab arm; n=311).
The median duration of exposure to OPDIVO was 2.8 months (range: 1 day to 
36.4 months) for the OPDIVO and ipilimumab arm and 6.6 months (range: 1 day to 
36.0 months) for the OPDIVO arm. In the OPDIVO and ipilimumab arm, 39% were 
exposed to OPDIVO for ≥6 months and 30% exposed for >1 year. In the OPDIVO arm, 
53% were exposed for ≥6 months and 40% for >1 year.
The population characteristics were: 65% male, median age 61 years, 97% White, 
baseline ECOG performance status 0 (73%) or 1 (27%), 93% with American Joint 
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage IV disease, 58% with M1c stage disease; 36% with 
elevated LDH at baseline, 4% with a history of brain metastasis, and 22% had received 
adjuvant therapy.
Serious adverse reactions (74% and 44%), adverse reactions leading to permanent 
discontinuation (47% and 18%) or to dosing delays (58% and 36%), and Grade 3 or 
4 adverse reactions (72% and 51%) all occurred more frequently in the OPDIVO and 
ipilimumab arm relative to the OPDIVO arm.
The most frequent (≥10%) serious adverse reactions in the OPDIVO and ipilimumab 
arm and the OPDIVO arm, respectively, were diarrhea (13% and 2.2%), colitis (10% 
and 1.9%), and pyrexia (10% and 1%). The most frequent adverse reactions leading 
to discontinuation of both drugs in the OPDIVO and ipilimumab arm and of OPDIVO in 
the OPDIVO arm, respectively, were colitis (10% and 0.6%), diarrhea (8% and 2.2%), 
increased ALT (4.8% and 1%), increased AST (4.5% and 0.6%), and pneumonitis (1.9% 
and 0.3%).
The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions in the OPDIVO and ipilimumab arm 
were fatigue, diarrhea, rash, nausea, pyrexia, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, 
decreased appetite, cough, headache, dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infection, 
arthralgia, and increased transaminases. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions 
in the OPDIVO arm were fatigue, rash, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, cough, 
pruritus, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, headache, constipation,

Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma
CHECKMATE-76K
The safety of OPDIVO as a single agent was evaluated in CHECKMATE-76K, a 
randomized (2:1), double-blind trial in 788 patients with completely resected Stage IIB/C 
melanoma who received OPDIVO 480 mg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 
4 weeks (n=524) or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 4 weeks 
(n=264) for up to 1 year [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The median duration of exposure 
was 11 months in patients treated with OPDIVO and 11 months in patients treated 
with placebo.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% of patients treated with OPDIVO. A fatal 
adverse reaction occurred in 1 (0.2%) patient (heart failure and acute kidney injury). 
Permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 17% of 
patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 
>1% of patients included diarrhea (1.1%), arthralgia (1.7%), and rash (1.7%).
Dosage interruptions of OPDIVO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 25% of patients. 
Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in >1% of patients included 
COVID-19 infection, infusion related reaction, diarrhea, arthralgia, and increased ALT.
The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, 
musculoskeletal pain, rash, diarrhea, and pruritus.

CHECKMATE-238
The safety of OPDIVO as a single agent was evaluated in CHECKMATE-238,  
a randomized (1:1), double-blind trial in 905 patients with completely resected  
Stage IIIB/C or Stage IV melanoma received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion 
over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n=452) or ipilimumab 10 mg/kg by intravenous infusion 
every 3 weeks for 4 doses then every 12 weeks beginning at Week 24 for up to 1 year 
(n=453) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The median duration of exposure was 11.5 months 
in OPDIVO-treated patients and was 2.7 months in ipilimumab-treated patients. In this 
ongoing trial, 74% of patients received OPDIVO for >6 months.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% of OPDIVO-treated patients. Study therapy 
was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of OPDIVO-treated patients and 42% of 
ipilimumab-treated patients. Twenty-eight percent of OPDIVO-treated patients had at 
least one omitted dose for an adverse reaction. Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurred 
in 25% of OPDIVO-treated patients.
The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of OPDIVO-
treated patients were diarrhea and increased lipase and amylase. The most common 
adverse reactions (at least 20%) were fatigue, diarrhea, rash, musculoskeletal pain, 
pruritus, headache, nausea, upper respiratory infection, and abdominal pain. The most 
common immune-mediated adverse reactions were rash (16%), diarrhea/colitis (6%), 
and hepatitis (3%).

The safety of OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was 
evaluated in CHECKMATE-816, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in patients 
with resectable NSCLC [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients received either OPDIVO 
360 mg administered in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered 
every 3 weeks for 3 cycles; or platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered every 
3 weeks for 3 cycles.
The median age of patients who received OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy or platinum-doublet chemotherapy was 65 years (range: 34 – 84);  
72% male; 47% White, 50% Asian, and 2% Black/African American.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients who were treated with OPDIVO 
in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Serious adverse reactions in >2% 
included pneumonia and vomiting. No fatal adverse reactions occurred in patients who 
received OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy.
Study therapy with OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was 
permanently discontinued for adverse reactions in 10% of patients and 30% had at least 
one treatment withheld for an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions 
(≥1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in combination with platinum-
doublet chemotherapy were anaphylactic reaction (1.7%), acute kidney injury (1.1%), 
rash (1.1%), and fatigue (1.1%).
The most common (>20%) adverse reactions were nausea, constipation, fatigue, 
decreased appetite, and rash. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities 
(≥2%) were neutropenia, hyperglycemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, increased amylase, 
anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hyponatremia.

Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The safety of OPDIVO in combination with neoadjuvant platinum-doublet chemotherapy 
followed by surgery and continued adjuvant treatment with OPDIVO as a single agent 
after surgery was evaluated in CHECKMATE-77T, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter 
trial in patients with previously untreated resectable Stage IIA (>4 cm) to IIIB (T3N2 or 
T4N2) NSCLC (per the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual 8th Edition) [see Clinical Studies 
(14.4)]. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required 
immunosuppression were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to OPDIVO was 
10.3 months (range: 1 day to 22.3 months).
The study population characteristics were: median age 66 years (range: 35 - 86); 71% male;  
72% White, 25% Asian, 1.7% Black/African American, and 1.5% other race; and 6% 
Hispanic or Latino.
Adverse reactions occurring in patients with resectable NSCLC receiving OPDIVO in 
combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, given as neoadjuvant treatment and 
followed as a single agent adjuvant treatment after surgery, were generally similar to 
those occurring in patients in other clinical trials across tumor types receiving OPDIVO in 
combination with chemotherapy.
Neoadjuvant Phase of CHECKMATE-77T
A total of 228 patients received at least 1 dose of OPDIVO in combination with platinum-
doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and 230 patients received at least 
1 dose of placebo in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant 
treatment.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients who received OPDIVO in 
combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment; the most 
frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions was pneumonia. Fatal adverse reactions 
occurred in 2.2% of patients, due to cerebrovascular accident, COVID-19 infection, 
hemoptysis, pneumonia, and pneumonitis (0.4% each).
Permanent discontinuation of any study drug due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% 
of patients who received OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as 
neoadjuvant treatment; the most frequent (≥1%) adverse reaction that led to permanent 
discontinuation of any study drug was peripheral sensory neuropathy (2.2%).
Of the 228 OPDIVO-treated patients and 230 placebo-treated patients who received 
neoadjuvant treatment, 5.3% (n=12) and 3.5% (n=8), respectively, did not receive 
surgery due to adverse reactions. The adverse reactions that led to cancellation of 
surgery in OPDIVO-treated patients were cerebrovascular accident, pneumonia, and 
colitis/diarrhea (2 patients each) and acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, hemoptysis, 
pneumonitis, COVID-19, and myositis (1 patient each).
Of the 178 OPDIVO-treated patients who received surgery, 4.5% (n=8) experienced delay 
of surgery (surgery more than 6 weeks from last neoadjuvant treatment) due to adverse 
reactions. Of the 178 placebo-treated patients who received surgery, 3.9% (n=7) 
experienced delay of surgery due to adverse reactions.
Of the 178 OPDIVO-treated patients who received surgery, 7% (n=13) did not receive 
adjuvant treatment due to adverse reactions. Of the 178 placebo-treated patients who 
received surgery, 2.8% (n=5) did not receive adjuvant treatment due to adverse reactions.
Adjuvant Phase of CHECKMATE-77T
A total of 142 patients in the OPDIVO arm and 152 patients in the placebo arm received 
at least 1 dose of adjuvant treatment.
Of the patients who received single agent OPDIVO as adjuvant treatment, 22% 
experienced serious adverse reactions; the most frequent serious adverse reaction 
was pneumonitis/ILD (2.8%). One fatal adverse reaction due to COVID-19 occurred. 
Permanent discontinuation of adjuvant OPDIVO due to an adverse reaction occurred 
in 14% of patients; the most frequent (≥1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent 
discontinuation of adjuvant OPDIVO were pneumonitis (4.2%) and diarrhea (1.4%).(Continued)OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
First-line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC: In Combination with Ipilimumab
The safety of OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-227,  
a randomized, multicenter, multi-cohort, open-label trial in patients with previously 
untreated metastatic or recurrent NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations 
[see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The trial excluded patients with untreated brain metastases, 
carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring 
systemic immunosuppression. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion 
over 30 minutes every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 
30 minutes every 6 weeks or platinum-doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 
4 cycles. The median duration of therapy in OPDIVO and ipilimumab-treated patients 
was 4.2 months (range: 1 day to 25.5 months): 39% of patients received OPDIVO and 
ipilimumab for >6 months and 23% of patients received OPDIVO and ipilimumab for  
>1 year. The population characteristics were: median age 64 years (range: 26 to 87); 
48% were ≥65 years of age, 76% White, and 67% male. Baseline ECOG performance 
status was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%), 85% were former/current smokers, 11% had brain 
metastases, 28% had squamous histology and 72% had non-squamous histology.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 58% of patients. OPDIVO and ipilimumab were 
discontinued for adverse reactions in 24% of patients and 53% had at least one dose 
withheld for an adverse reaction.
The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, diarrhea/colitis, 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypophysitis. 
Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.7% of patients; these included events of 
pneumonitis (4 patients), myocarditis, acute kidney injury, shock, hyperglycemia, 
multi-system organ failure, and renal failure. The most common (≥20%) adverse 
reactions were fatigue, rash, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea/colitis, 
dyspnea, cough, hepatitis, nausea, and pruritus.

First-line Treatment of Metastatic or Recurrent NSCLC: In Combination with Ipilimumab 
and Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy
The safety of OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab and platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy was evaluated in CHECKMATE-9LA [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Patients 
received either OPDIVO 360 mg administered every 3 weeks in combination with 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg administered every 6 weeks and platinum-doublet chemotherapy (Continued)OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)administered every 3 weeks for 2 cycles; or platinum-doublet chemotherapy 
administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. The median duration of therapy in OPDIVO in 
combination with ipilimumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy was 6 months (range: 
1 day to 19 months): 50% of patients received OPDIVO and ipilimumab for >6 months 
and 13% of patients received OPDIVO and ipilimumab for >1 year.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 57% of patients who were treated with OPDIVO 
in combination with ipilimumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The most frequent 
(>2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, anemia, 
acute kidney injury, musculoskeletal pain, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure. 
Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 7 (2%) patients, and included hepatic toxicity, acute 
renal failure, sepsis, pneumonitis, diarrhea with hypokalemia, and massive hemoptysis in 
the setting of thrombocytopenia.
Study therapy with OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab and platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy was permanently discontinued for adverse reactions in 24% of patients 
and 56% had at least one treatment withheld for an adverse reaction. The most common 
(>20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, diarrhea, rash, 
decreased appetite, constipation, and pruritus.

Second-line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC
The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-017, a randomized open-label, 
multicenter trial in patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC and progression on or 
after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen and in CHECKMATE-057, 
a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in patients with metastatic non-squamous 
NSCLC and progression on or after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy 
regimen [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. These trials excluded patients with active 
autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or with 
symptomatic interstitial lung disease. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg over 60 minutes 
by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously every 
3 weeks. The median duration of therapy in OPDIVO-treated patients in CHECKMATE-017 
was 3.3 months (range: 1 day to 21.7 + months) and in CHECKMATE-057 was 
2.6 months (range: 0 to 24.0 + months). In CHECKMATE-017, 36% of patients received 
OPDIVO for at least 6 months and 18% of patients received OPDIVO for at least 1 year 
and in CHECKMATE-057, 30% of patients received OPDIVO for >6 months and 20% of 
patients received OPDIVO for >1 year.
Across both trials, the median age of OPDIVO-treated patients was 61 years (range: 
37  to  85); 38% were ≥65 years of age, 61% were male, and 91% were White. 
Ten  percent of patients had brain metastases and ECOG performance status was 
0 (26%) or 1 (74%).
In CHECKMATE-057, in the OPDIVO arm, seven deaths were due to infection including 
one case of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, four were due to pulmonary embolism, 
and one death was due to limbic encephalitis. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 
46% of patients receiving OPDIVO. OPDIVO was discontinued in 11% of patients and was 
delayed in 28% of patients for an adverse reaction.
The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients receiving 
OPDIVO were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, dyspnea, pyrexia, pleural effusion, 
pneumonitis, and respiratory failure. Across both trials, the most common adverse 
reactions (≥20%) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, cough, dyspnea, and 
decreased appetite.

Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
The safety of OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-743, 
a randomized, open-label trial in patients with previously untreated unresectable 
malignant pleural mesothelioma [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. Patients received either 
OPDIVO 3 mg/kg over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion every 6 weeks for up to 2 years; or 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles. The median duration of therapy in 
OPDIVO and ipilimumab-treated patients was 5.6 months (range: 0 to 26.2 months); 
48% of patients received OPDIVO and ipilimumab for >6 months and 24% of patients 
received OPDIVO and ipilimumab for >1 year.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 54% of patients who were treated with OPDIVO in 
combination with ipilimumab. The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were 
pneumonia, pyrexia, diarrhea, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, dyspnea, acute kidney injury, 
infusion-related reaction, musculoskeletal pain, and pulmonary embolism. Fatal adverse 
reactions occurred in 4 (1.3%) patients and included pneumonitis, acute heart failure, 
sepsis and encephalitis.
Both OPDIVO and ipilimumab were permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions 
in 23% of patients and 52% had at least one dose withheld due to an adverse reaction.
The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, 
diarrhea, dyspnea, nausea, decreased appetite, cough, and pruritus.

ipilimumab-treated patients and 7.8 months (range: 1 day to 20.2 + months) in sunitinib-
treated patients. In this trial, 57% of patients in the OPDIVO and ipilimumab arm were 
exposed to treatment for >6 months and 38% of patients were exposed to treatment 
for >1 year.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients receiving OPDIVO and 
ipilimumab. Study therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 31% of OPDIVO 
and ipilimumab patients. Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients receiving OPDIVO and 
ipilimumab had a dose interruption for an adverse reaction.
The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with 
OPDIVO and ipilimumab were diarrhea, pyrexia, pneumonia, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, 
acute kidney injury, dyspnea, adrenal insufficiency, and colitis; in patients treated with 
sunitinib, they were pneumonia, pleural effusion, and dyspnea. The most common 
adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, rash, diarrhea, 
musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, nausea, cough, pyrexia, arthralgia, and decreased 
appetite. The most common laboratory abnormalities which have worsened compared 
to baseline in ≥30% of OPDIVO and ipilimumab-treated patients include increased lipase, 
anemia, increased creatinine, increased ALT, increased AST, hyponatremia, increased 
amylase, and lymphopenia.

The safety of OPDIVO with cabozantinib was evaluated in CHECKMATE-9ER, a 
randomized, open-label study in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC. 
Patients received OPDIVO 240 mg over 30 minutes every 2 weeks with cabozantinib 
40 mg orally once daily (n = 320) or sunitinib 50 mg daily, administered orally for 
4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off (n = 320) [see Clinical Studies (14.7)]. 
Cabozantinib could be interrupted or reduced to 20 mg daily or 20 mg every other day. 
The median duration of treatment was 14 months (range: 0.2 to 27 months) in OPDIVO 
and cabozantinib-treated patients. In this trial, 82% of patients in the OPDIVO and 
cabozantinib arm were exposed to treatment for >6 months and 60% of patients were 
exposed to treatment for >1 year.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 48% of patients receiving OPDIVO and 
cabozantinib. The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were diarrhea, 
pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, urinary tract infection, and hyponatremia. 
Fatal intestinal perforations occurred in 3 (0.9%) patients.
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of either OPDIVO or cabozantinib occurred 
in 20% of patients: 7% OPDIVO only, 8% cabozantinib only, and 6% both drugs due to 
same adverse reaction at the same time. Adverse reaction leading to dose interruption 
or reduction of either OPDIVO or cabozantinib occurred in 83% of patients: 3% OPDIVO 
only, 46% cabozantinib only, and 21% both drugs due to same adverse reaction at the 
same time, and 6% both drugs sequentially.
The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥20% of patients treated with 
OPDIVO and cabozantinib were diarrhea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia syndrome, stomatitis, rash, hypertension, hypothyroidism, 
musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, dysgeusia, abdominal pain, cough, 
and upper respiratory tract infection.

Previously Treated Renal Cell Carcinoma
CHECKMATE-025
The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-025, a randomized open-label trial 
in 803 patients with advanced RCC who had experienced disease progression during 
or after at least one anti-angiogenic treatment regimen received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg over 
60 minutes by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (n = 406) or everolimus 10 mg daily 
(n = 397) [see Clinical Studies (14.7)]. The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months 
(range: 1 day to 29.6 + months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and 3.7 months (range: 
6 days to 25.7 + months) in everolimus-treated patients.
Rate of death on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose was 4.7% on the 
OPDIVO arm. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of patients receiving OPDIVO. 
Study therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 16% of OPDIVO patients. 
Forty-four percent (44%) of patients receiving OPDIVO had a dose interruption for an 
adverse reaction.
The most frequent serious adverse reactions in at least 2% of patients were: acute 
kidney injury, pleural effusion, pneumonia, diarrhea, and hypercalcemia. The most 
common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue, cough, nausea, rash, dyspnea, diarrhea, 
constipation, decreased appetite, back pain, and arthralgia. The most common laboratory 
abnormalities which have worsened compared to baseline in ≥30% of patients 
include increased creatinine, lymphopenia, anemia, increased AST, increased alkaline 
phosphatase, hyponatremia, increased triglycerides, and hyperkalemia. In addition, 
among patients with TSH < ULN at baseline, a greater proportion of patients experienced 
a treatment-emergent elevation of TSH >ULN in the OPDIVO group compared to the 
everolimus group (26% and 14%, respectively).

The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in 266 adult patients with cHL (243 patients in 
the CHECKMATE-205 and 23 patients in the CHECKMATE-039 trials) [see Clinical 
Studies (14.8)]. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 
60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression, maximal clinical benefit, or 
unacceptable toxicity.
The median age was 34 years (range: 18 to 72), 98% of patients had received autologous 
HSCT, none had received allogeneic HSCT, and 74% had received brentuximab 
vedotin. The median number of prior systemic regimens was 4 (range: 2 to 15).  
Patients received a median of 23 doses (cycles) of OPDIVO (range: 1 to 48), with a 
median duration of therapy of 11 months (range: 0 to 23 months).
Eleven patients died from causes other than disease progression: 3 from adverse 
reactions within 30 days of the last nivolumab dose, 2 from infection 8 to 9 months after 
completing nivolumab, and 6 from complications of allogeneic HSCT. Serious adverse 
reactions occurred in 26% of patients. Dose delay for an adverse reaction occurred in 
34% of patients. OPDIVO was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients.
The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥1% of patients were 
pneumonia, infusion-related reaction, pyrexia, colitis or diarrhea, pleural effusion, 
pneumonitis, and rash. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) among all patients 
were upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, pyrexia, musculoskeletal 
pain, rash, nausea, and pruritus.

Immune-mediated pneumonitis: In CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039, pneumonitis, 
including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 6.0% (16/266) of patients receiving 
OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving 
OPDIVO (one Grade 3 and 12 Grade 2). The median time to onset was 4.5 months 
(range: 5 days to 12 months). All 13 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 
resolution in 12. Four patients permanently discontinued OPDIVO due to pneumonitis. 
Eight patients continued OPDIVO (three after dose delay), of whom two had recurrence 
of pneumonitis.
Peripheral neuropathy: Treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy was reported 
in 12% (31/266) of all patients receiving OPDIVO. Twenty-eight patients (11%) had 
new-onset peripheral neuropathy and 3 patients had worsening of neuropathy from 
baseline. The median time to onset was 50 (range: 1 to 309) days.
Complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO: Of 17 patients with cHL from the 
CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039 trials who underwent allogeneic HSCT after 
treatment with OPDIVO, 6 patients (35%) died from transplant-related complications.  
Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe (Grade 3 to 4) or refractory GVHD. 
Hyperacute GVHD occurred in 2 patients (12%) and Grade 3 or higher GVHD was 
reported in 5 patients (29%). Hepatic VOD occurred in 1 patient, who received reduced-
intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure.
Table 32 summarizes laboratory abnormalities in patients with cHL. The most common 
(≥20%) treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities included cytopenias, liver function 
abnormalities, and increased lipase. Other common findings (≥10%) included increased 
creatinine, electrolyte abnormalities, and increased amylase.

in 11 of 69 (16%).
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-141, a randomized, 
active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic 
SCCHN with progression during or within 6 months of receiving prior platinum-based 
therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.9)]. The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune 
disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or recurrent or 
metastatic carcinoma of the nasopharynx, squamous cell carcinoma of unknown 
primary histology, salivary gland or non-squamous histologies (e.g., mucosal melanoma). 
Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 
2 weeks (n = 236) or investigator’s choice of either cetuximab (400 mg/m2 initial dose 
intravenously followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly), or methotrexate (40 to 60 mg/m2 
intravenously weekly), or docetaxel (30 to 40 mg/m2 intravenously weekly). The median 
duration of exposure to nivolumab was 1.9 months (range: 1 day to 16.1 + months) in 
OPDIVO-treated patients. In this trial, 18% of patients received OPDIVO for >6 months 
and 2.5% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year.The median age of all randomized patients was 60 years (range: 28 to 83); 28% of 
patients in the OPDIVO group were ≥65 years of age and 37% in the comparator group 
were ≥65 years of age, 83% were male and 83% were White, 12% were Asian, and 4% 
were Black. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (20%) or 1 (78%), 45% of patients 
received only one prior line of systemic therapy, the remaining 55% of patients had two 
or more prior lines of therapy, and 90% had prior radiation therapy.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 49% of patients receiving OPDIVO. OPDIVO was 
discontinued in 14% of patients and was delayed in 24% of patients for an adverse 
reaction. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities occurring in patients with 
SCCHN were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma and NSCLC.
The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients 
receiving OPDIVO were pneumonia, dyspnea, respiratory failure, respiratory tract 
infection, and sepsis. The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of 
OPDIVO-treated patients and at a higher incidence than investigator’s choice were 
cough and dyspnea. The most common laboratory abnormalities occurring in ≥10% 
of OPDIVO-treated patients and at a higher incidence than investigator’s choice were 
increased alkaline phosphatase, increased amylase, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, and 
increased TSH.
Adjuvant Treatment of Urothelial Carcinoma (UC)
The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-274, a randomized, double-blind, 
multicenter trial of adjuvant OPDIVO versus placebo in adult patients who had undergone 
radical resection of UC originating in the bladder or upper urinary tract (renal pelvis or 
ureter) and were at high risk of recurrence [see Clinical Studies (14.10)]. Patients received 
OPDIVO 240 mg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (n  = 351) or 
placebo (n = 348) until recurrence or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 1 year.  
The median duration of OPDIVO treatment was 8.8 months (range: 0 to 12.5).
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of OPDIVO patients. The most frequent

First-line Treatment of Unresectable or Metastatic UC
The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-901, a randomized, open-label trial 
in cisplatin-eligible patients with unresectable or metastatic UC [see Clinical Studies 
(14.10)]. Patients received either OPDIVO 360 mg with cisplatin and gemcitabine every 
3 weeks for up to 6 cycles followed by single-agent OPDIVO 480 mg every 4 weeks up 
to 2 years (n=304), or cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy every 3 weeks for up 
to 6 cycles (n=288). Patients discontinuing cisplatin alone were permitted to switch to 
carboplatin.
Among patients who received OPDIVO with chemotherapy, the median duration 
of OPDIVO exposure was 7.4 months (range: 0.03 to 47.9 months). Serious adverse 
reactions occurred in 48% of patients receiving OPDIVO in combination with 
chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients 
who received OPDIVO with chemotherapy were urinary tract infection (4.9%), acute 
kidney injury (4.3%), anemia (3%), pulmonary embolism (2.6%), sepsis (2.3%), and 
platelet count decreased (2.3%). The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% 
of patients) were nausea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, constipation, decreased appetite, 
rash, vomiting, and peripheral neuropathy.(Continued)Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.6% of patients who received OPDIVO in 
combination with chemotherapy; these included sepsis (1%).
OPDIVO and/or chemotherapy were discontinued in 30% of patients and were delayed in 
67% of patients for an adverse reaction.

Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic UC
The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-275, a single arm trial in which 
270 patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC had disease progression during or 
following platinum-containing chemotherapy or had disease progression within 12 months 
of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy [see 
Clinical Studies (14.10)]. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 
60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median  
duration of treatment was 3.3 months (range: 0 to 13.4 +). Forty-six percent (46%) of 
patients had a dose interruption for an adverse reaction.
Fourteen patients (5.2%) died from causes other than disease progression. This includes 
4 patients (1.5%) who died from pneumonitis or cardiovascular failure which was 
attributed to treatment with OPDIVO. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 54% of 
patients. OPDIVO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 17% of patients.
The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients were urinary 
tract infection, sepsis, diarrhea, small intestine obstruction, and general physical health 
deterioration. The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were 
fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and decreased appetite.

MSI-H or dMMR Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The safety of OPDIVO administered as a single agent or in combination with ipilimumab 
was evaluated in CHECKMATE-142, a multicenter, non-randomized, multiple parallel-
cohort, open-label trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1 1)]. In CHECKMATE-142, 74 patients 
with mCRC received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes 
every 2 weeks until disease progression or until intolerable toxicity and 119 patients 
with mCRC received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks 
for 4 doses, then OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or until 
unacceptable toxicity.
In the OPDIVO with ipilimumab cohort, serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of 
patients. Treatment was discontinued in 13% of patients and delayed in 45% of patients 
for an adverse reaction. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% 
of patients were colitis/diarrhea, hepatic events, abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, 
pyrexia, and dehydration. The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of 
patients) were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, pruritus, 
nausea, rash, decreased appetite, and vomiting.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The safety of OPDIVO 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was evaluated 
in a subgroup comprising 49 patients with HCC and Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis 
enrolled in Cohort 4 of CHECKMATE-040, a multicenter, multiple-cohort, open-label 
trial [see Clinical Studies (14.12)] who progressed on or were intolerant to sorafenib. 
OPDIVO and ipilimumab were administered every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by 
single-agent OPDIVO 240 mg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. During the OPDIVO and ipilimumab combination period, 33 of 49 (67%) 
patients received all 4 planned doses of OPDIVO and ipilimumab. During the entire 
treatment period, the median duration of exposure to OPDIVO was 5.1 months (range:  
0 to 35 + months) and to ipilimumab was 2.1 months (range: 0 to 4.5 months).  
Forty-seven percent of patients were exposed to treatment for >6 months, and 35% of 
patients were exposed to treatment for >1 year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 
59% of patients. Treatment was discontinued in 29% of patients and delayed in 65% of 
patients for an adverse reaction.
The most frequent serious adverse reactions (reported in ≥4% of patients) were pyrexia, 
diarrhea, anemia, increased AST, adrenal insufficiency, ascites, esophageal varices 
hemorrhage, hyponatremia, increased blood bilirubin, and pneumonitis.

was defined as a 1 log increase in HCV RNA from baseline.
Esophageal Cancer
Adjuvant Treatment of Resected Esophageal or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-577, a randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blinded, multicenter trial in 792 treated patients with completely 
resected (negative margins) esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer who had 
residual pathologic disease following chemoradiotherapy (CRT) [see Clinical Studies 
(14.13)]. The trial excluded patients who did not receive concurrent CRT prior to surgery, 
had stage IV resectable disease, autoimmune disease, or any condition requiring 
systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) 
or other immunosuppressive medications. Patients received either OPDIVO 240 mg or 
placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 16 weeks followed 
by 480 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 4 weeks beginning 
at week 17. Patients were treated until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or 
for up to 1-year total duration. The median duration of exposure was 10.1 months 
(range: <0.1 to 14 months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and 9 months (range: <0.1 to 
15 months) in placebo-treated patients. Among patients who received OPDIVO, 61% 
were exposed for >6 months and 54% were exposed for >9 months.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients receiving OPDIVO. A serious 
adverse reaction reported in ≥2% of patients who received OPDIVO was pneumonitis. 
A fatal adverse reaction of myocardial infarction occurred in one patient who 
received OPDIVO.
OPDIVO was discontinued in 12% of patients and was delayed in 28% of patients for

First-line Treatment of Unresectable Advanced or Metastatic ESCC
The safety of OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy or in combination with 
ipilimumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-648, a randomized, active-controlled, 
multicenter, open-label trial in patients with previously untreated unresectable advanced, 
recurrent or metastatic ESCC [see Clinical Studies (14.13)]. Patients received one of the 
following treatments:
• OPDIVO 240 mg on days 1 and 15, 5-FU (fluorouracil) 800 mg/m2/day intravenously  
on days 1 through 5 (for 5 days), and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 intravenously on day 
1 (of a 4-week cycle).
• OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 
6 weeks.
• 5-FU (fluorouracil) 800 mg/m2/day intravenously on days 1 through 5 (for 5 days),  
and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 (of a 4-week cycle).
Among patients who received OPDIVO with chemotherapy, the median duration of 
exposure was 5.7 months (range: 0.1 to 30.6 months). Among patients who received 
OPDIVO and ipilimumab, the median duration of exposure was 2.8 months (range: 
0 to 24 months).
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients receiving OPDIVO in combination 
with chemotherapy and in 69% of patients receiving OPDIVO in combination with 
ipilimumab. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients 
who received OPDIVO with chemotherapy were pneumonia (11%), dysphagia (7%), 
esophageal stenosis (2.9%), acute kidney injury (2.9%), and pyrexia (2.3%). The most 
frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients who received OPDIVO 
with ipilimumab were pneumonia (10%), pyrexia (4.3%), pneumonitis (4%), aspiration 
pneumonia (3.7%), dysphagia (3.7%), hepatic function abnormal (2.8%), decreased 
appetite (2.8%), adrenal insufficiency (2.5%), and dehydration (2.5%).
Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 5 (1.6%) patients who received OPDIVO in 
combination with chemotherapy; these included pneumonitis, pneumatosis intestinalis, 
pneumonia, and acute kidney injury and in 5 (1.6%) patients who received OPDIVO 
in combination with ipilimumab; these included pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, 
pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
OPDIVO and/or chemotherapy were discontinued in 39% of patients and were delayed in 
71% of patients for an adverse reaction. OPDIVO and/or ipilimumab were discontinued in 
23% of patients and were delayed in 46% of patients for an adverse reaction.
The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥20% of patients treated with 
OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy were nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue, 
constipation, stomatitis, diarrhea, and vomiting. The most common adverse reactions 
reported in ≥20% of patients treated with OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab were 
rash, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, diarrhea, and constipation.

Previously-Treated Unresectable Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Esophageal 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)
The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in ATTRACTION-3, a randomized, active-controlled, 
open-label, multicenter trial in 209 patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or 
metastatic ESCC refractory or intolerant to at least one fluoropyrimidine- and platinum- 
based chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.13)]. The trial excluded patients who were 
refractory or intolerant to taxane therapy, had brain metastases that were symptomatic 
or required treatment, had autoimmune disease, used systemic corticosteroids or 
immunosuppressants, had apparent tumor invasion of organs adjacent to the esophageal 
tumor or had stents in the esophagus or respiratory tract. Patients received OPDIVO 
240 mg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (n = 209) or investigator’s 
choice: docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 65) or paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 
intravenously once a week for 6 weeks followed by 1 week off (n = 143). Patients were 
treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of 
exposure was 2.6 months (range: 0 to 29.2 months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and 
2.6 months (range: 0 to 21.4 months) in docetaxel- or paclitaxel-treated patients. 
Among patients who received OPDIVO, 26% were exposed for >6 months and 10% were  
exposed for >1 year.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Serious 
adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients who received OPDIVO were pneumonia, 
esophageal fistula, interstitial lung disease and pyrexia. The following fatal adverse 
reactions occurred in patients who received OPDIVO: interstitial lung disease or 
pneumonitis (1.4%), pneumonia (1.0%), septic shock (0.5%), esophageal fistula 
(0.5%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (0.5%), pulmonary embolism (0.5%), and sudden 
death (0.5%).
OPDIVO was discontinued in 13% of patients and was delayed in 27% of patients for 
an adverse reaction.

Gastric Cancer, Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer, and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
The safety of OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy was evaluated in 
CHECKMATE-649, a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial in patients with previously 
untreated advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, and 
esophageal adenocarcinoma [see Clinical Studies (14.14)]. The trial excluded patients 
who were known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive or had 
untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients were randomized to 
receive OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy or chemotherapy. Patients received 
one of the following treatments:
• OPDIVO 240 mg in combination with mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and 
oxaliplatin) every 2 weeks or mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks.
• OPDIVO 360 mg in combination with CapeOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) every 
3 weeks or CapeOX every 3 weeks.
Patients were treated with OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy or chemotherapy 
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 2 years. The median duration 
of exposure was 6.8 months (range: 0 to 33.5 months) in OPDIVO and chemotherapy-
treated patients. Among patients who received OPDIVO and chemotherapy, 54% were 
exposed for >6 months and 28% were exposed for >1 year.
Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 16 (2.0%) patients who were treated with OPDIVO 
in combination with chemotherapy; these included pneumonitis (4 patients), febrile 
neutropenia (2 patients), stroke (2 patients), gastrointestinal toxicity, intestinal mucositis, 
septic shock, pneumonia, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, mesenteric vessel 
thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Serious adverse reactions 
occurred in 52% of patients treated with OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy. 
OPDIVO and/or chemotherapy were discontinued in 44% of patients and at least one 
dose was withheld in 76% of patients due to an adverse reaction.
The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with 
OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy were vomiting (3.7%), pneumonia (3.6%), 
anemia (3.6%), pyrexia (2.8%), diarrhea (2.7%), febrile neutropenia (2.6%), and 
pneumonitis (2.4%). The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥20% of patients 
treated with OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy were peripheral neuropathy, 
nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, constipation, 
and musculoskeletal pain.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of 
OPDIVO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain 
size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal 
relationship to drug exposure.
Eye: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome

(including fatal cases), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (including fatal cases)
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Risk Summary
Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.1)], OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nivolumab to 
cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in 
increased abortion and premature infant death (see Data). Human IgG4 is known to 
cross the placental barrier and nivolumab is an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4); therefore, 
nivolumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus.  
The effects of OPDIVO are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy. There are no available data on OPDIVO use in pregnant women to evaluate a 
drug-associated risk. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.
The background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% 
and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.
Data
Animal Data
A central function of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining 
maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. Blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown 
in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to increase fetal 
loss. The effects of nivolumab on prenatal and postnatal development were evaluated in 
monkeys that received nivolumab twice weekly from the onset of organogenesis through 
delivery, at exposure levels of between 9 and 42 times higher than those observed at 
the clinical dose of 3 mg/kg (based on AUC). Nivolumab administration resulted in a 
non-dose-related increase in spontaneous abortion and increased neonatal death. 
Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to nivolumab may increase the risk 
of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response and 
immune-mediated disorders have been reported in PD-1 knockout mice. In surviving 
infants (18 of 32 compared to 11 of 16 vehicle-exposed infants) of cynomolgus 
monkeys treated with nivolumab, there were no apparent malformations and no effects 
on neurobehavioral, immunological, or clinical pathology parameters throughout the 
6-month postnatal period.8.2 Lactation
Risk Summary
There are no data on the presence of nivolumab in human milk, the effects on the 
breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during 
treatment and for 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO.
8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
Pregnancy Testing
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating OPDIVO 
[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Contraception
OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective 
contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for 5 months following the last dose.
8.4 Pediatric Use
The safety and effectiveness of OPDIVO have been established in pediatric patients aged 
12 years and older for the following indications: as a single agent and in combination 
with ipilimumab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as a 
single agent for the adjuvant treatment of completely resected Stage IIB, Stage IIC, 
Stage III, or Stage IV melanoma and, as a single agent or in combination with 
ipilimumab for the treatment of MSI-H or dMMR mCRC that has progressed following 
treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Use of OPDIVO for these 
indications is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in 
adults with melanoma or MSI-H or dMMR mCRC and additional pharmacokinetic data 
in pediatric patients. Nivolumab exposure in pediatric patients 12 years and older is 
comparable to that of adults and the courses of melanoma and MSI-H or dMMR mCRC 
are similar in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older to that of adults to allow 
extrapolation of safety and efficacy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.3), Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.11)].
The safety and effectiveness of OPDIVO have not been established for pediatric patients 
younger than 12 years old with melanoma or MSI-H or dMMR mCRC.
The safety and effectiveness of OPDIVO have not been established in pediatric patients 
with non-small cell lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, advanced renal cell 
carcinoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and 
neck, urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, 
gastroesophageal cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma.
8.5 Geriatric Use
Single Agent
Of 3569 patients with melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, 
ESCC, and esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer who were randomized to 
single agent OPDIVO in clinical studies, 41% were 65 years and over and 10% were 
75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed 
between elderly patients and younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.5, 
14.7, 14.10, 14.13, 14.14)].
In patients with cHL, recurrent head and neck SCC, or dMMR or MSI-H metastatic CRC 
(mCRC) who were treated with single agent OPDIVO in clinical studies did not include 
sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they 
respond differently from younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.8, 14.9, 14.11)].
OPDIVO in Combination with Ipilimumab
Of the 314 patients with melanoma who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination 
with ipilimumab, 41% were 65 years or older and 11% were 75 years or older.  
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were reported between elderly patients 
and younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].
Of the 576 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination with 
ipilimumab, 48% were 65 years or older and 10% were 75 years or older. No overall 
difference in safety was reported between older patients and younger patients; however, 
there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients aged 
75 years or older (29%) relative to all patients who received OPDIVO with ipilimumab 
(18%). Of the 396 patients in the primary efficacy population (PD-L1 ≥1%) randomized 
to OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab, the hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.70 
(95% CI: 0.55, 0.89) in the 199 patients younger than 65 years compared to 0.91 (95% CI:  
0.72, 1.15) in the 197 patients 65 years or older [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].
Of the 303 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who were randomized to 
OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab, 77% were 65 years old or older and 26% were 
75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between older patients 
and younger patients; however, there were higher rates of serious adverse reactions and 
discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (68% and 
35%, respectively) relative to all patients who received OPDIVO with ipilimumab (54% 
and 28%, respectively). For patients aged 75 years or older who received chemotherapy, 
the rate of serious adverse reactions was 34% and the discontinuation rate due to 
adverse reactions was 26% relative to 28% and 19% respectively for all patients. The 
hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.11) in the 71 patients younger 
than 65 years compared to 0.74 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.93) in the 232 patients 65 years or 
older randomized to OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)Of the 550 patients with renal cell carcinoma who were randomized to OPDIVO in 
combination with ipilimumab, 38% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years 
or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between elderly patients and 
younger patients. In elderly patients with intermediate or poor risk, no overall difference 
in effectiveness was reported [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].
Of the 49 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated with OPDIVO in 
combination with ipilimumab, 29% were between 65 years and 74 years of age and 8% 
were 75 years or older. Clinical studies of OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab did 
not include sufficient numbers of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma aged 65 and 
over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients [see Clinical 
Studies (14.12)].
Of the 325 patients with ESCC who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination 
with ipilimumab, 43% were 65 years old or older and 7% were 75 years or older.  
No overall difference in safety was reported between older patients and younger patients; 
however, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients 
aged 75 years or older (38%) relative to all patients who received OPDIVO with 
ipilimumab (23%). For patients aged 75 years or older who received chemotherapy, the 
discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 33% relative to 23% for all patients 
[see Clinical Studies (14.13)].
OPDIVO in Combination with Platinum-Containing Chemotherapy
Of the 179 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination 
with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, 48% were 65 years old or older and 6% were 
75 years old or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were reported 
between patients older and younger than 65 years [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].
Of the 229 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to OPDIVO 360 mg in 
combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles, 
followed by OPDIVO 480 mg every 4 weeks, 56% were 65 years old or older and 
7% were 75 years old or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were 
reported between patients older and younger than 65 years.
Of the 1,110 patients with ESCC, GC, GEJC, or EAC who were randomized to OPDIVO 
in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy), 42% 
were 65 years or older and 10% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety 
was reported between elderly patients and younger patients [see Clinical Studies 
(14.13, 14.14)].
Of the 304 patients with UC who were treated with OPDIVO in combination with 
gemcitabine and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, 40% were 65 years or older and 11% 
were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed 
between patients 65 years of age and over and younger patients. Clinical studies of 
OPDIVO with platinum-doublet chemotherapy did not include sufficient numbers of 
patients aged 75 years and over to determine whether safety and effectiveness differs 
compared to younger patients. [see Clinical Studies (14.10)].
OPDIVO in Combination with Ipilimumab and Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy
Of the 361 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to OPDIVO in combination with 
ipilimumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, 51% were 65 years or older and 
10% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between 
older patients and younger patients; however, there was a higher discontinuation rate 
due to adverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (43%) relative to all patients 
who received OPDIVO with ipilimumab and chemotherapy (24%). For patients aged 
75 years or older who received chemotherapy only, the discontinuation rate due to 
adverse reactions was 16% relative to all patients who had a discontinuation rate of 
13%. Based on an updated analysis for overall survival, of the 361 patients randomized 
to OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy, the 
hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.80) in the 176 patients 
younger than 65 years compared to 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.95) in the 185 patients 
65 years or older [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].
OPDIVO in Combination with Cabozantinib
Of the 320 patients with renal cell carcinoma who were treated with OPDIVO in 
combination with cabozantinib, 41% were 65 years or older and 9% were 75 years 
or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between elderly patients and 
younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].
11 DESCRIPTION
Nivolumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody. Nivolumab is 
an IgG4 kappa immunoglobulin that has a calculated molecular mass of 146 kDa. It is 
expressed in a recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line.
OPDIVO is a sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, clear to opalescent, colorless to 
pale-yellow liquid that may contain light (few) particles.
OPDIVO (nivolumab) injection for intravenous use is supplied in single-dose vials. 
Each mL of OPDIVO solution contains nivolumab 10 mg, mannitol (30 mg), pentetic acid 
(0.008 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), sodium chloride (2.92 mg), sodium citrate dihydrate 
(5.88 mg), and Water for Injection, USP . May contain hydrochloric acid and/or sodium 
hydroxide to adjust pH to 6.12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, 
inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs 
in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active 
T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) 
monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with 
PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, 
including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking 
PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.
Combined nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) mediated inhibition 
results in enhanced T-cell function that is greater than the effects of either antibody 
alone, and results in improved anti-tumor responses in metastatic melanoma and 
advanced RCC. In murine syngeneic tumor models, dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 
resulted in increased anti-tumor activity.
12.2 Pharmacodynamics
There are no clinically significant exposure-response relationships for efficacy or 
safety for nivolumab monotherapy across the approved dosing regimens, regardless of 
cancer type.
12.3 Pharmacokinetics
Nivolumab pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed using a population PK approach for both 
single agent OPDIVO and OPDIVO with ipilimumab. The PK of nivolumab was studied 
in patients over a dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg administered as a single 
dose or as multiple doses of OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion every 2 or 
3 weeks. The exposure to nivolumab increases dose proportionally over the dose range 
of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. The predicted exposure of nivolumab 
after a 30-minute infusion is comparable to that observed with a 60-minute infusion. 
Steady-state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 12 weeks when administered 
at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was 3.7-fold.
Distribution
The geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) and coefficient of 
variation (CV%) is 6.8 L (27.3%).
Elimination
Nivolumab clearance (CL) decreases over time, with a mean maximal reduction from 
baseline values (CV%) of 24.5% (47.6%) resulting in a geometric mean steady-state 
clearance (CLss) (CV%) of 8.2 mL/h (53.9%) in patients with metastatic tumors; the 
decrease in CLss is not considered clinically relevant. Nivolumab clearance does not 
decrease over time in patients with completely resected melanoma, as the geometric 
mean population clearance is 24% lower in this patient population compared 
with patients with metastatic melanoma at steady state.
The geometric mean elimination half-life (t 1/2) is 25 days (77.5%).
Specific Populations
The following factors had no clinically important effect on the clearance of nivolumab: 
age (29 to 87 years), weight (35 to 160 kg), sex, race, baseline LDH, PD-L1 expression, 
solid tumor type, tumor size, renal impairment (eGFR ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 
mild (total bilirubin [TB] less than or equal to the ULN and AST greater than ULN or  
TB greater than 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) or moderate hepatic impairment 
(TB greater than 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST). Nivolumab has not been studied in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (TB greater than 3 times ULN and any AST).
Pediatric Patients
The exposures of nivolumab in pediatric patients 12 years of age or older are comparable 
to those in adults at the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
Drug Interaction Studies
When OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks was administered in combination with ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the CL of nivolumab and ipilimumab were unchanged compared 
to nivolumab or ipilimumab administered alone.
When OPDIVO 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks was administered in combination with ipilimumab 
3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the CL of nivolumab was increased by 29% compared to 
OPDIVO administered alone and the CL of ipilimumab was unchanged compared to 
ipilimumab administered alone.
When OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks was administered in combination with ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, the CL of nivolumab was unchanged compared to OPDIVO 
administered alone and the CL of ipilimumab was increased by 30% compared to 
ipilimumab administered alone.
When OPDIVO 360 mg every 3 weeks was administered in combination with ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg every 6 weeks and chemotherapy, the CL of nivolumab was unchanged 
compared to OPDIVO administered alone and the CL of ipilimumab increased by 22% 
compared to ipilimumab administered alone.
12.6 Immunogenicity
The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and 
specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons 
of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of OPDIVO or of other 
nivolumab products.
Anti-drug antibody and neutralizing antibody responses were monitored throughout the 
treatment period where the benefit to risk ratio was assessed. Incidence of anti-drug 
antibodies and neutralizing antibodies are presented in Table 51.

Effects of Anti-Drug Antibodies
Presence of treatment-emergent anti-nivolumab antibodies increased nivolumab 
clearance by up to 20% after administration of nivolumab as monotherapy or in 
combination with ipilimumab. These anti-drug antibody-associated pharmacokinetic 
changes were not considered to be clinically significant. There was no identified clinically 
significant effect of anti-drug antibodies on incidence of infusion-related reactions.  
The effects of anti-drug antibodies on effectiveness have not been fully characterized.
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
No studies have been performed to assess the potential of nivolumab for carcinogenicity 
or genotoxicity. Fertility studies have not been performed with nivolumab. In 1-month 
and 3-month repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects 
in the male and female reproductive organs; however, most animals in these studies 
were not sexually mature.
13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology
In animal models, inhibition of PD-1 signaling increased the severity of some infections 
and enhanced inflammatory responses. M. tuberculosis–infected PD-1 knockout mice 
exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type controls, which correlated 
with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in these animals. PD-1 
knockout mice have also shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis virus.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
14.1 Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
Previously Treated Metastatic Melanoma
CHECKMATE-037 (NCT01721746) was a multicenter, open-label trial that randomized 
(2:1) patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma to receive OPDIVO 3 mg/kg  
intravenously every 2 weeks or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, either  
single-agent dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or the combination of carboplatin 
AUC 6 intravenously every 3 weeks and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 intravenously every 
3 weeks. Patients were required to have progression of disease on or following 
ipilimumab treatment and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The 
trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring 
systemic immunosuppression, ocular melanoma, active brain metastasis, or a history 
of Grade 4 ipilimumab-related adverse reactions (except for endocrinopathies) 
or Grade 3 ipilimumab-related adverse reactions that had not resolved or were 
inadequately controlled within 12 weeks of the initiating event. Tumor assessments were 
conducted 9 weeks after randomization then every 6 weeks for the first year, and every  
12 weeks thereafter.Efficacy was evaluated in a single-arm, non-comparative, planned interim analysis 
of the first 120 patients who received OPDIVO in CHECKMATE-037 and in whom the 
minimum duration of follow-up was 6 months. The major efficacy outcome measures 
in this population were confirmed overall response rate (ORR) as measured by blinded 
independent central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST 1.1) and duration of response.
Among the 120 patients treated with OPDIVO, the median age was 58 years (range: 
25 to 88), 65% of patients were male, 98% were White, and the ECOG performance 
score was 0 (58%) or 1 (42%). Disease characteristics were M1c disease (76%),  
BRAF V600 mutation positive (22%), elevated LDH (56%), history of brain metastases 
(18%), and two or more prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease (68%).
The ORR was 32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23, 41), consisting of 4 complete  
responses and 34 partial responses in OPDIVO-treated patients. Of 38 patients  
with responses, 87% had ongoing responses with durations ranging from 
2.6+ to 10 + months, which included 13 patients with ongoing responses of 6 months 
or longer.
There were responses in patients with and without BRAF V600 mutation-positive 
melanoma. A total of 405 patients were randomized and the median duration of OS 
was 15.7 months (95% CI: 12.9, 19.9) in OPDIVO-treated patients compared to 
14.4 months (95% CI: 11.7, 18.2) (HR 0.95; 95.54% CI: 0.73, 1.24) in patients assigned 
to investigator’s choice of treatment. Figure 1 summarizes the OS results.

differences in baseline factors.
Previously Untreated Metastatic Melanoma
CHECKMATE-066
CHECKMATE-066 (NCT01721772) was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized (1:1) 
trial in 418 patients with BRAF V600 wild-type unresectable or metastatic melanoma. 
Patients were randomized to receive either OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion 
every 2 weeks or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by PD-L1 
status (≥5% of tumor cell membrane staining by immunohistochemistry vs. <5% or 
indeterminate result) and M stage (M0/M1a/M1b versus M1c). Key eligibility criteria 
included histologically confirmed, unresectable or metastatic, cutaneous, mucosal, or 
acral melanoma; no prior therapy for metastatic disease; completion of prior adjuvant or 
neoadjuvant therapy at least 6 weeks prior to randomization; ECOG performance status 
0 or 1; absence of autoimmune disease; and absence of active brain or leptomeningeal 
metastases. The trial excluded patients with ocular melanoma. Tumor assessments were 
conducted 9 weeks after randomization then every 6 weeks for the first year and then 
every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival 
(OS). Additional outcome measures included investigator-assessed progression-free 
survival (PFS) and ORR per RECIST v1.1.
The trial population characteristics were: median age was 65 years (range: 18 to 87), 
59% were male, and 99.5% were White. Disease characteristics were M1c stage 
disease (61%), cutaneous melanoma (74%), mucosal melanoma (11%), elevated LDH 
level (37%), PD-L1 ≥5% tumor cell membrane expression (35%), and history of brain 
metastasis (4%). More patients in the OPDIVO arm had an ECOG performance status of 
0 (71% vs. 58%).OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)CHECKMATE-066 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for the 
OPDIVO arm compared with the dacarbazine arm in an interim analysis based on  
47% of the total planned events for OS. At the time of analysis, 88% (63/72) of 
OPDIVO-treated patients had ongoing responses, which included 43 patients with 
ongoing response of 6 months or longer. Efficacy results are shown in Table 52 
and Figure 2.

CHECKMATE-067
CHECKMATE-067 (NCT01844505) was a multicenter, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind 
trial in 945 patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma to 
one of the following arms: OPDIVO and ipilimumab, OPDIVO, or ipilimumab. Patients were 
required to have completed adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment at least 6 weeks prior to 
randomization and have no prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody and no evidence 
of active brain metastasis, ocular melanoma, autoimmune disease, or medical conditions 
requiring systemic immunosuppression.
Patients were randomized to receive:
• OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, 
followed by OPDIVO as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion 
every 2 weeks (OPDIVO and ipilimumab arm),
• OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (OPDIVO arm), or
• Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by placebo 
every 2 weeks (ipilimumab arm).
Randomization was stratified by PD-L1 expression (≥5% vs. <5% tumor cell membrane 
expression) as determined by a clinical trial assay, BRAF V600 mutation status, and 
M stage per the AJCC staging system (M0, M1a, M1b vs. M1c). Tumor assessments were  conducted 12 weeks after randomization then every 6 weeks for the first year, and every 
12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed 
PFS per RECIST v1.1 and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were confirmed 
ORR and duration of response.
The trial population characteristics were: median age 61 years (range: 18 to 90); 65% male; 
97% White; ECOG performance score 0 (73%) or 1 (27%). Disease characteristics were:  
AJCC Stage IV disease (93%); M1c disease (58%); elevated LDH (36%); history of brain 
metastases (4%); BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma (32%); PD-L1 ≥5% tumor 
cell membrane expression as determined by the clinical trials assay (46%); and prior 
adjuvant therapy (22%).
CHECKMATE-067 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and

14.2 Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma
CHECKMATE-76K
CHECKMATE-76K (NCT04099251) was a randomized, double-blind trial in 790 patients 
with completely resected Stage IIB/C melanoma. Patients were randomized (2:1)  
to receive OPDIVO 480 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for up  
to 1  year or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Enrollment required 
complete resection of the primary melanoma with negative margins and a negative 
sentinel lymph node within 12 weeks prior to randomization, and ECOG performance 
status of 0 or 1. The trial excluded patients with ocular/uveal or mucosal melanoma, 
autoimmune disease, any condition requiring systemic treatment with either 
corticosteroids (≥10 mg daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive 
medications, as well as patients with prior therapy for melanoma except surgery. 
Randomization was stratified by AJCC 8th staging system edition (T3b vs. T4a vs. T4b). 
The major efficacy outcome measure was recurrence-free survival (RFS) defined as the 
time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, 
or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death, from any cause, whichever 
occurred first and as assessed by the investigator. Tumor assessments were conducted 
every 26 weeks during years 1-3 and every 52 weeks thereafter until year 5.
The trial population characteristics were: median age 62 years (range: 19 to 92), 61% 
were male, 98% were White, 0.4% Black or African American, 0.1% Asian, and 1.1% 
race unknown, 2.2% Hispanic or Latino, 58% Not Hispanic or Latino, 40% ethnicity 
unknown, and 94% had an ECOG performance status of 0. Sixty one percent had stage 
IIB and 39% had stage IIC melanoma.
CHECKMATE-76K demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in RFS for patients 
randomized to the OPDIVO arm compared with the placebo arm. Efficacy results are 
shown in Table 54 and Figure 4.Table 54: Efficacy Results - CHECKMATE-76K

CHECKMATE-238
CHECKMATE-238 (NCT02388906) was a randomized, double-blind trial in 906 patients 
with completely resected Stage IIIB/C or Stage IV melanoma. Patients were randomized 
(1:1) to receive OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or ipilimumab 
10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses then every 12 weeks beginning 
at Week 24 for up to 1 year. Enrollment required complete resection of melanoma 
with margins negative for disease within 12 weeks prior to randomization. The trial 
excluded patients with a history of ocular/uveal melanoma, autoimmune disease, and 
any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (≥10 mg daily 
prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications, as well as 
patients with prior therapy for melanoma except surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy after 
neurosurgical resection for lesions of the central nervous system, and prior adjuvant 
interferon completed ≥6 months prior to randomization. Randomization was stratified by 
PD-L1 status (positive [based on 5% level] vs. negative/indeterminate) and AJCC stage 
(Stage IIIB/C vs. Stage IV M1a-M1b vs. Stage IV M1c). The major efficacy outcome 
measure was recurrence-free survival (RFS) defined as the time between the date of 
randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), new 
primary melanoma, or death, from any cause, whichever occurs first and as assessed 
by the investigator. Patients underwent imaging for tumor recurrence every 12 weeks for 
the first 2 years then every 6 months thereafter.
The trial population characteristics were: median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 86), 
58% were male, 95% were White, and 90% had an ECOG performance status of 0. 
Disease characteristics were AJCC Stage IIIB (34%), Stage IIIC (47%), Stage IV (19%), 
M1a-b (14%), BRAF V600 mutation positive (42%), BRAF wild-type (45%), elevated  
LDH (8%), PD-L1 ≥5% tumor cell membrane expression determined by clinical trial 
assay (34%), macroscopic lymph nodes (48%), and tumor ulceration (32%).
CHECKMATE-238 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in RFS for patients 
randomized to the OPDIVO arm compared with the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg arm. Efficacy 
results are shown in Table 55 and Figure 5.OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)Table 55: Efficacy Results - CHECKMATE-238

14.3 Neoadjuvant Treatment of Resectable (Tumors ≥4 cm or Node Positive) 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
CHECKMATE-816 (NCT02998528) was a randomized, open label trial in patients with 
resectable NSCLC. The trial included patients with resectable, histologically confirmed 
Stage IB (≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC (per the 7th edition American Joint Committee on 
Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) staging criteria), ECOG 
performance status 0 or 1, and measurable disease (per RECIST version 1.1). Patients 
with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC, known EGFR mutations or ALK translocations, 
Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy, active autoimmune disease, or medical 
conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the study.
Patients were randomized to receive either:
• OPDIVO 360 mg administered intravenously over 30 minutes and platinum-
doublet chemotherapy administered intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 
3 cycles, or
• platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for up to 3 cycles.
Platinum-doublet chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 or 200 mg/m2 
and carboplatin AUC 5 or AUC 6 (any histology); pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 
75 mg/m2 (non-squamous histology); or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 or 1250 mg/m2 and 
cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (squamous histology). In the platinum-doublet chemotherapy arm, 
two additional treatment regimen options included vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 or 30 mg/m2 
and cisplatin 75 mg/m2; or docetaxel 60 mg/m2 or 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 
(any histology).Stratification factors for randomization were tumor PD-L1 expression level (≥1% 
versus <1% or non-quantifiable), disease stage (IB/II versus IIIA), and sex (male versus 
female). Tumor assessments were performed at baseline, within 14 days of surgery, 
every 12 weeks after surgery for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and every 
year for 5 years until disease recurrence or progression. The major efficacy outcome 
measures were event-free survival (EFS) based on blinded independent central review 
(BICR) assessment and pathologic complete response (pCR) as evaluated by blinded 
independent pathology review (BIPR). Additional efficacy outcome measures included OS.
A total of 358 patients were randomized to receive either OPDIVO in combination with 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy (n = 179) or platinum-doublet chemotherapy (n = 179). 
The median age was 65 years (range: 34 to 84) with 51% of patients ≥65 years and 7% 
of patients ≥75 years, 50% were Asian, 47% were White, 2% were Black, and 71% were 
male. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (67%) or 1 (33%); 50% had tumors with 
PD-L1 expression ≥1%; 35% had stage IB/II and 64% had stage IIIA disease; 51% had 
tumors with squamous histology and 49% had tumors with non-squamous histology; 
and 89% were former/current smokers.
Eighty-three percent of patients in the OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy arm had definitive surgery compared to 75% of patients in the platinum-
doublet chemotherapy arm.
The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in EFS and pCR. Efficacy 
results are presented in Table 56 and Figure 6.

for statistical significance.
14.4 Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung 
Cancer
The efficacy of OPDIVO, in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, followed 
by surgery, and continued adjuvant treatment with OPDIVO as a single agent, was 
investigated in CHECKMATE-77T (NCT04025879), a randomized, double-blind trial 
in 461 patients with resectable NSCLC. The trial included patients with resectable, 
suspected or histologically confirmed Stage IIA (>4 cm) to IIIB (T3-T4 N2) NSCLC  
(per the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual),  
and ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Patients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC, 
EGFR mutations or known ALK translocations, brain metastasis, Grade 2 or greater 
peripheral neuropathy, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis 
(symptomatic and/or requiring treatment), active autoimmune disease, or medical 
conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the study. 
Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression level (≥1% versus <1% 
versus indeterminate/not evaluable), disease stage (Stage II versus Stage III), and tumor 
histology (squamous versus nonsquamous).
Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either:
• Neoadjuvant OPDIVO 360 mg administered intravenously over 30 minutes in 
combination with one of the following platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimens 
every 3 weeks for four cycles:
 ○Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 or 200 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 5 or AUC 6 
(any histology)
 ○Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5 or 
AUC 6 (nonsquamous histology)
 ○Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (squamous histology).
Within 90 days after the surgery, OPDIVO 480 mg was administered intravenously 
over 30 minutes every 4 weeks.
or
• Neoadjuvant placebo administered intravenously over 30 minutes in combination 
with platinum-doublet chemotherapy (see above)  every 3 weeks for four cycles. 
Within 90 days after the surgery, placebo was administered intravenously over 
30 minutes every 4 weeks.
All study medications were administered via intravenous infusion. Treatment continued 
until disease progression, recurrence, or unacceptable toxicity for up to 13 cycles 
(1 year). Tumor assessments were performed every 12 weeks for 2 years, then 
every 24 weeks for up to 5 years or until disease recurrence or progression was 
confirmed by BICR.
The trial was not designed to isolate the effect of OPDIVO in each phase (neoadjuvant or 
adjuvant) of treatment.
The major efficacy outcome measure was event-free survival (EFS) based on BICR 
assessment. Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall survival (OS), 
pathologic complete response (pCR), and major pathologic response (MPR).
The median age was 66 years (range: 35 to 86); 71% were male; 72% were White,  
25% were Asian, 1.7% were Black, and 1.5% were mixed race/ race unknown/not reported;  
and 6% were Hispanic or Latino. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (62%) or  
1 (38%); 56% had tumors with PD-L1 expression ≥1% and 40% had tumors with PD-L1 
expression <1%; 35% had stage II and 64% had stage III disease; 23% had N1 disease 
and 39% had N2 disease; 51% had tumors with squamous histology and 49% had 
tumors with nonsquamous histology; and 90% were former/current smokers.
Seventy-eight percent of patients in the neoadjuvant OPDIVO in combination with 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy followed by adjuvant OPDIVO arm had definitive 
surgery compared to 77% of patients in the neoadjuvant placebo and platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy followed by placebo arm.
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in EFS for patients 
treated with neoadjuvant OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy 
followed by single agent OPDIVO compared with patients randomized to placebo in 
combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy followed by placebo. Efficacy results

At the time of the EFS analysis, OS data were immature.
14.5 Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
First-line Treatment of Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Expressing PD-L1 
(≥1%): In Combination with Ipilimumab
CHECKMATE-227 (NCT02477826) was a randomized, open-label, multi-part trial in 
patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC. The study included patients (18 years of 
age or older) with histologically confirmed Stage IV or recurrent NSCLC (per the 7th 
International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer [IASLC] classification), ECOG 
performance status 0 or 1, and no prior anticancer therapy. Patients were enrolled 
regardless of their tumor PD-L1 status. Patients with known EGFR mutations or 
ALK translocations sensitive to available targeted inhibitor therapy, untreated brain 
metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical 
conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the study. 
Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically returned to baseline 
at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or 
decreasing dose of <10 mg daily prednisone equivalents.
Primary efficacy results were based on Part 1a of the study, which was limited to patients 
with PD-L1 tumor expression ≥1%. Tumor specimens were evaluated prospectively using 
the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central laboratory. Randomization was stratified 
by tumor histology (non-squamous versus squamous). The evaluation of efficacy relied 
on the comparison between:
• OPDIVO 3 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 2 weeks in 
combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes 
every 6 weeks; or
• Platinum-doublet chemotherapyOPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)Chemotherapy regimens consisted of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) 
or pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) for non-squamous NSCLC 
or gemcitabine (1000 or 1250 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or gemcitabine 
(1000 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5) (gemcitabine was administered on Days 1 and 8 
of each cycle) for squamous NSCLC.
Study treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 
24 months. Treatment continued beyond disease progression if a patient was clinically 
stable and was considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients who 
discontinued combination therapy because of an adverse event attributed to ipilimumab 
were permitted to continue OPDIVO as a single agent. Tumor assessments were 
performed every 6 weeks from the first dose of study treatment for the first 12 months, 
then every 12 weeks until disease progression or study treatment was discontinued. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures 
included PFS, ORR, and duration of response as assessed by BICR.
In Part 1a, a total of 793 patients were randomized to receive either OPDIVO in 
combination with ipilimumab (n=396) or platinum-doublet chemotherapy (n=397). 
The median age was 64 years (range: 26 to 87) with 49% of patients ≥65 years and 
10% of patients ≥75 years, 76% White, and 65% male. Baseline ECOG performance 
status was 0 (34%) or 1 (65%), 50% with PD-L1 ≥50%, 29% with squamous and 
71% with non-squamous histology, 10% had brain metastases, and 85% were former/
current smokers.
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for PD-L1 ≥1% 
patients randomized to the OPDIVO and ipilimumab arm compared with the platinum-
doublet chemotherapy arm. The OS results are presented in Table 58 and Figure 8.

First-line Treatment of Metastatic or Recurrent NSCLC: In Combination with Ipilimumab 
and Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy
CHECKMATE-9LA (NCT03215706) was a randomized, open-label trial in patients with 
metastatic or recurrent NSCLC. The trial included patients (18 years of age or older) with 
histologically confirmed Stage IV or recurrent NSCLC (per the 7th International Association 
for the Study of Lung Cancer classification [IASLC]), ECOG performance status 0 or 1, and 
no prior anticancer therapy (including EGFR and ALK inhibitors) for metastatic disease. 
Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumor PD-L1 status. Patients with known 
EGFR mutations or ALK translocations sensitive to available targeted inhibitor therapy, 
untreated brain metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or 
medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the study. 
Patients with stable brain metastases were eligible for enrollment.
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either:
• OPDIVO 360 mg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks, 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 6 weeks, 
and platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered intravenously every 3 weeks 
for 2 cycles, or
• platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.
Platinum-doublet chemotherapy consisted of either carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) and 
pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 for 
non-squamous NSCLC; or carboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 for squamous 
NSCLC. Patients with non-squamous NSCLC in the control arm could receive optional 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy. Stratification factors for randomization were tumor 
PD-L1 expression level (≥1% versus <1% or non-quantifiable), histology (squamous 
versus non-squamous), and sex (male versus female). Study treatment continued until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 2 years. Treatment could continue 
beyond disease progression if a patient was clinically stable and was considered to 
be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients who discontinued combination 
therapy because of an adverse reaction attributed to ipilimumab were permitted to 
continue OPDIVO as a single agent as part of the study. Tumor assessments were 
performed every 6 weeks from the first dose of study treatment for the first 12 months, 
then every 12 weeks until disease progression or study treatment was discontinued. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures 
included PFS, ORR, and duration of response as assessed by BICR.
A total of 719 patients were randomized to receive either OPDIVO in combination 
with ipilimumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy (n = 361) or platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy (n = 358). The median age was 65 years (range: 26 to 86) with 51% 
of patients ≥65 years and 10% of patients ≥75 years. The majority of patients were 
White  (89%) and male (70%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (31%) or 
1 (68%), 57% had tumors with PD-L1 expression ≥1% and 37% had tumors with PD-L1 
expression that was <1%, 32% had tumors with squamous histology and 68% had 
tumors with non-squamous histology, 17% had CNS metastases, and 86% were former 
or current smokers.
The study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in OS, PFS, and ORR. Efficacy 
results from the prespecified interim analysis when 351 events were observed (87% of 
the planned number of events for final analysis) are presented in Table 59.

Second-line Treatment of Metastatic Squamous NSCLC
CHECKMATE-017 (NCT01642004) was a randomized (1:1), open-label trial in 272  
patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC who had experienced disease progression 
during or after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients 
received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (n = 135) or docetaxel 
75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 137). Randomization was stratified by prior 
paclitaxel vs. other prior treatment and region (US/Canada vs. Europe vs. Rest of World). 
This trial included patients regardless of their PD-L1 status. The trial excluded patients 
with autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, 
symptomatic interstitial lung disease, or untreated brain metastasis. Patients with treated 
brain metastases were eligible if neurologically returned to baseline at least 2 weeks 
prior to enrollment, and either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose 
of <10 mg daily prednisone equivalents. The first tumor assessments were conducted 
9 weeks after randomization and continued every 6 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy 
outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were investigator-
assessed ORR and PFS.
The trial population characteristics were: median age was 63 years (range: 39 to 85) 
with 44% ≥65 years of age and 11% ≥75 years of age. The majority of patients were 
White (93%) and male (76%); the majority of patients were enrolled in Europe (57%) 
with the remainder in US/Canada (32%) and the rest of the world (11%). Baseline ECOG 
performance status was 0 (24%) or 1 (76%) and 92% were former/current smokers. 
Baseline disease characteristics of the population as reported by investigators were 
Stage IIIb (19%), Stage IV (80%), and brain metastases (6%). All patients received prior 
therapy with a platinum-doublet regimen and 99% of patients had tumors of squamous-
cell histology.
The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients 
randomized to OPDIVO as compared with docetaxel at the prespecified interim analysis (Continued)when 199 events were observed (86% of the planned number of events for final 
analysis). Efficacy results are shown in Table 60 and Figure 10.

Archival tumor specimens were retrospectively evaluated for PD-L1 expression.  
Across the trial population, 17% of 272 patients had non-quantifiable results.  
Among the 225 patients with quantifiable results, 47% had PD-L1 negative squamous 
NSCLC, defined as <1% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 and 53% had PD-L1 positive 
squamous NSCLC defined as ≥1% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1. In pre-specified 
exploratory subgroup analyses, the hazard ratios for survival were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.37, 
0.92) in the PD-L1 negative subgroup and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.05) in the PD-L1 
positive subgroup.
Second-line Treatment of Metastatic Non-Squamous NSCLC
CHECKMATE-057 (NCT01673867) was a randomized (1:1), open-label trial in 
582 patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who had experienced disease 
progression during or after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen. 
Appropriate prior targeted therapy in patients with known sensitizing EGFR mutation 
or ALK translocation was allowed. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous 
infusion every 2 weeks (n = 292) or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks 
(n = 290). Randomization was stratified by prior maintenance therapy (yes vs. no) and 
number of prior therapies (1 vs. 2). The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, symptomatic interstitial lung 
disease, or untreated brain metastasis. Patients with treated brain metastases were 
eligible if neurologically stable. The first tumor assessments were conducted 9 weeks 
after randomization and continued every 6 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome 
measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed ORR 
and PFS. In addition, prespecified analyses were conducted in subgroups defined by 
PD-L1 expression.
The trial population characteristics: median age was 62 years (range: 21 to 85) with  
42% of patients ≥65 years and 7% of patients ≥75 years. The majority of patients 
were White (92%) and male (55%); the majority of patients were enrolled in Europe 
(46%) followed by the US/Canada (37%) and the rest of the world (17%). Baseline 
ECOG performance status was 0 (31%) or 1 (69%), 79% were former/current smokers, 
3.6% had NSCLC with ALK rearrangement, 14% had NSCLC with EGFR mutation, and 
12% had previously treated brain metastases. Prior therapy included platinum-doublet 
regimen (100%) and 40% received maintenance therapy as part of the first-line 
regimen. Histologic subtypes included adenocarcinoma (93%), large cell (2.4%), and 
bronchoalveolar (0.9%).
CHECKMATE-057 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients 
randomized to OPDIVO as compared with docetaxel at the prespecified interim analysis 
when 413 events were observed (93% of the planned number of events for final 
analysis). Efficacy results are shown in Table 61 and Figure 11.

14.6 Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
CHECKMATE-743 (NCT02899299) was a randomized, open-label trial in patients 
with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. The trial included patients with 
histologically confirmed and previously untreated malignant pleural mesothelioma with 
no palliative radiotherapy within 14 days of initiation of therapy. Patients with interstitial 
lung disease, active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic 
immunosuppression, or active brain metastasis were excluded from the trial.
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either:
• OPDIVO 3 mg/kg over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion every 6 weeks for 
up to 2 years, or
• cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, or carboplatin 5 AUC and 
pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.
Stratification factors for randomization were tumor histology (epithelioid vs. sarcomatoid 
or mixed histology subtypes) and sex (male vs. female). Study treatment continued 
for up to 2 years, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who 
discontinued combination therapy because of an adverse reaction attributed to 
ipilimumab were permitted to continue OPDIVO as a single agent. Treatment could 
continue beyond disease progression if a patient was clinically stable and was 
considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Tumor assessments were 
performed every 6 weeks from the first dose of study treatment for the first 12 months, 
then every 12 weeks until disease progression or study treatment was discontinued. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures 
included PFS, ORR, and duration of response as assessed by BICR utilizing modified 
RECIST criteria.
A total of 605 patients were randomized to receive either OPDIVO in combination with 
ipilimumab (n = 303) or chemotherapy (n = 302). The median age was 69 years (range: 
25 to 89), with 72% of patients ≥65 years and 26% ≥75 years; 85% were White, 11% 
were Asian, and 77% were male. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (40%) or 
1 (60%), 35% had Stage III and 51% had Stage IV disease, 75% had epithelioid and 
25% had non-epithelioid histology, 75% had tumors with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, and 
22% had tumors with PD-L1 expression <1%.OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients

In a prespecified exploratory analysis based on histology, in the subgroup of patients 
with epithelioid histology, the hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.06), 
with median OS of 18.7 months in the OPDIVO and ipilimumab arm and 16.2 months 
in the chemotherapy arm. In the subgroup of patients with non-epithelioid histology, the 
HR for OS was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.70), with median OS of 16.9 months in the OPDIVO 
and ipilimumab arm and 8.8 months in the chemotherapy arm.
14.7 Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
First-line Renal Cell Carcinoma
CHECKMATE-214
CHECKMATE-214 (NCT02231749) was a randomized (1:1), open-label trial in patients 
with previously untreated advanced RCC. Patients were included regardless of their 
PD-L1 status. CHECKMATE-214 excluded patients with any history of or concurrent 
brain metastases, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients were stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database 
Consortium (IMDC) prognostic score and region.
Efficacy was evaluated in intermediate/poor risk patients with at least 1 or more of 6 
prognostic risk factors as per the IMDC criteria (less than one year from time of initial 
renal cell carcinoma diagnosis to randomization, Karnofsky performance status <80%, 
hemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium of >10 mg/dL, platelet 
count greater than the upper limit of normal, and absolute neutrophil count greater than 
the upper limit of normal).
Patients were randomized to OPDIVO 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg intravenously 
every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by OPDIVO 3 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks 
(n = 425), or sunitinib 50 mg orally daily for the first 4 weeks of a 6-week cycle (n = 422). 
Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
The trial population characteristics were: median age was 61 years (range: 21 to 85) 
with 38% ≥65 years of age and 8% ≥75 years of age. The majority of patients were 
male (73%) and White (87%) and 26% and 74% of patients had a baseline KPS of  
70% to 80% and 90% to 100%, respectively.
The major efficacy outcome measures were OS, PFS (independent radiographic review 
committee [IRRC]-assessed) and confirmed ORR (IRRC-assessed) in intermediate/
poor risk patients. In this population, the trial demonstrated statistically significant 
improvement in OS and ORR for patients randomized to OPDIVO and ipilimumab as 
compared with sunitinib (Table 63 and Figure 15). OS benefit was observed regardless 
of PD-L1 expression level. The trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS. Efficacy results are shown in Table 63 and Figure 15.

CHECKMATE-214 also randomized 249 favorable risk patients as per IMDC criteria 
to OPDIVO and ipilimumab (n = 125) or to sunitinib (n = 124). These patients were not 
evaluated as part of the efficacy analysis population. OS in favorable risk patients 
receiving OPDIVO and ipilimumab compared to sunitinib has a hazard ratio of 1.45 
(95% CI: 0.75, 2.81). The efficacy of OPDIVO and ipilimumab in previously untreated 
renal cell carcinoma with favorable-risk disease has not been established.
CHECKMATE-9ER
CHECKMATE-9ER (NCT03141177) was a randomized, open-label study of OPDIVO 
combined with cabozantinib versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated 
advanced RCC. CHECKMATE-9ER excluded patients with autoimmune disease or other 
medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients were stratified by 
IMDC prognostic score (favorable vs. intermediate vs. poor), PD-L1 tumor expression 
(≥1% vs. <1% or indeterminate), and region (US/Canada/Western Europe/Northern 
Europe vs. Rest of World).
Patients were randomized to OPDIVO 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks and 
cabozantinib 40 mg orally daily (n  = 323), or sunitinib 50 mg orally daily for the first 
4 weeks of a 6-week cycle (4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off) (n = 328). 
Treatment continued until disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or unacceptable toxicity. 
Treatment beyond RECIST-defined disease progression was permitted if the patient was 
clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Tumor 
assessments were performed at baseline, after randomization at Week 12, then every 
6 weeks until Week 60, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
The trial population characteristics were: median age 61 years (range: 28 to 90) with 
38% ≥65 years of age and 10% ≥75 years of age. The majority of patients were male 
(74%) and White (82%) and 23% and 77% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70% to 
80% and 90% to 100%, respectively. Patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 
22% favorable, 58% intermediate, and 20% poor.
The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS (BICR assessed). Additional efficacy 
outcome measures were OS and ORR (BICR assessed). The trial demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR for patients randomized to 
OPDIVO and cabozantinib compared with sunitinib. Consistent results for PFS were 
observed across pre-specified subgroups of IMDC risk categories and PD-L1 tumor 
expression status. An updated OS analysis was conducted when 271 deaths were 
observed based on the pre-specified number of deaths for the pre-planned final analysis 
of OS. Efficacy results are shown in Table 64 and Figures 16 and 17.OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)Figure 17:  Updated Overall Survival - CHECKMATE-9ER

In an exploratory analysis, the updated analysis of OS in patients with IMDC favorable, 
intermediate, intermediate/poor, and poor risk demonstrated a HR (95% CI) of 1.03 (0.55, 
1.92), 0.74 (0.54, 1.01), 0.65 (0.50, 0.85), and 0.49 (0.31, 0.79), respectively.
Previously Treated Renal Cell Carcinoma
CHECKMATE-025
CHECKMATE-025 (NCT01668784) was a randomized (1:1), open-label trial in patients 
with advanced RCC who had experienced disease progression during or after one or two 
prior anti-angiogenic therapy regimens. Patients had to have a Karnofsky Performance 
Score (KPS) ≥70% and patients were included regardless of their PD-L1 status. The trial 
excluded patients with any history of or concurrent brain metastases, prior treatment 
with an mTOR inhibitor, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring 
systemic immunosuppression. Patients were stratified by region, Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Risk Group and the number of prior anti-angiogenic 
therapies. Patients were randomized OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 
2 weeks (n = 410) or everolimus 10 mg orally daily (n = 411). The first tumor assessments 
were conducted 8 weeks after randomization and continued every 8 weeks thereafter 
for the first year and then every 12 weeks until progression or treatment discontinuation, 
whichever occurred later. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS).
The trial population characteristics were: median age was 62 years (range: 18 to 88) 
with 40% ≥65 years of age and 9% ≥75 years of age. The majority of patients were 
male (75%) and White (88%) and 34% and 66% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70% 
to 80% and 90% to 100%, respectively. The majority of patients (77%) were treated with 
one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. Patient distribution by MSKCC risk groups was 34% 
favorable, 47% intermediate, and 19% poor.
The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients 
randomized to OPDIVO as compared with everolimus at the prespecified interim analysis 
when 398 events were observed (70% of the planned number of events for final 
analysis). OS benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level. Efficacy results 
are shown in Table 65 and Figure 18.Table 65: Efficacy Results - CHECKMATE-025

14.8 Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
Two studies evaluated the efficacy of OPDIVO as a single agent in adult patients with 
cHL after failure of autologous HSCT.
CHECKMATE-205 (NCT02181738) was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, multicohort 
trial in cHL. CHECKMATE-039 (NCT01592370) was an open-label, multicenter, dose 
escalation trial that included cHL. Both studies included patients regardless of their 
tumor PD-L1 status and excluded patients with ECOG performance status of 2 or greater, 
autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, hepatic transaminases more 
than 3 times ULN, creatinine clearance <40 mL/min, prior allogeneic HSCT, or chest 
irradiation within 24 weeks. In addition, both studies required an adjusted diffusion 
capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of over 60% in patients with prior 
pulmonary toxicity.
Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until disease 
progression, maximal clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity. A cycle consisted of one 
dose. Dose reduction was not permitted.
Efficacy was evaluated by ORR as determined by an IRRC. Additional outcome measures 
included duration of response (DOR).
Efficacy was evaluated in 95 patients in CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039 
combined who had failure of autologous HSCT and post-transplantation brentuximab 
vedotin. The median age was 37 years (range: 18 to 72). The majority were male (64%) 
and White (87%). Patients had received a median of 5 prior systemic regimens (range: 
2 to 15). They received a median of 27 doses of OPDIVO (range: 3 to 48), with a median 
duration of therapy of 14 months (range: 1 to 23 months). Efficacy results are shown 
in Table 66.OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)Table 66: Efficacy in cHL after Autologous HSCT and Post-transplantation

Efficacy was also evaluated in 258 patients in CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039 
combined who had relapsed or progressive cHL after autologous HSCT. The analysis 
included the group described above. The median age was 34 years (range: 18 to 72). 
The majority were male (59%) and White (86%). Patients had a median of 4 prior 
systemic regimens (range: 2 to 15), with 85% having 3 or more prior systemic regimens 
and 76% having prior brentuximab vedotin. Of the 195 patients having prior brentuximab 
vedotin, 17% received it only before autologous HSCT, 78% received it only after HSCT, 
and 5% received it both before and after HSCT. Patients received a median of 21 doses 
of OPDIVO (range: 1 to 48), with a median duration of therapy of 10 months (range:  
0 to 23 months). Efficacy results are shown in Table 67.

14.9 Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
CHECKMATE-141 (NCT02105636) was a randomized (2:1), active-controlled, open-label 
trial enrolling patients with metastatic or recurrent SCCHN who had experienced 
disease progression during or within 6 months of receiving platinum-based therapy 
administered in either the adjuvant, neo-adjuvant, primary (unresectable locally 
advanced) or metastatic setting. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, 
medical conditions requiring immunosuppression, recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of 
the nasopharynx, squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary histology, salivary gland 
or non-squamous histologies (e.g., mucosal melanoma), or untreated brain metastasis. 
Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically stable. Patients 
were randomized to receive OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks 
or investigator’s choice of cetuximab (400 mg/m2 initial dose intravenously followed 
by 250 mg/m2 weekly), or methotrexate (40 to 60 mg/m2 intravenously weekly), or 
docetaxel (30 to 40 mg/m2 intravenously weekly).
Randomization was stratified by prior cetuximab treatment (yes/no). The first tumor 
assessments were conducted 9 weeks after randomization and continued every 6 weeks 
thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome 
measures were PFS and ORR.A total of 361 patients were randomized; 240 patients to the OPDIVO arm and 
121 patients to the investigator’s choice arm (docetaxel: 45%; methotrexate: 43%; and 
cetuximab: 12%). The trial population characteristics were: median age was 60 years 
(range: 28 to 83) with 31% ≥65 years of age, 83% were White, 12% Asian, and 
4% were Black, and 83% male. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (20%) or 
1 (78%), 76% were former/current smokers, 90% had Stage IV disease, 45% of patients 
received only one prior line of systemic therapy, the remaining 55% received two or 
more prior lines of systemic therapy, and 25% had HPV p16-positive tumors, 24% had 
HPV p16-negative tumors, and 51% had unknown status.
The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients 
randomized to OPDIVO as compared with investigator’s choice at a pre-specified 
interim analysis (78% of the planned number of events for final analysis). There were 
no statistically significant differences between the two arms for PFS (HR=0.89; 95% 
CI: 0.70, 1.13) or ORR (13.3% [95% CI: 9.3, 18.3] vs. 5.8% [95% CI: 2.4, 11.6] for 
nivolumab and investigator’s choice, respectively). Efficacy results are shown in Table 68 
and Figure 19.

Archival tumor specimens were retrospectively evaluated for PD-L1 expression using 
the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay. Across the trial population, 28% (101/361) of 
patients had non-quantifiable results. Among the 260 patients with quantifiable results, 
43% (111/260) had PD-L1 negative SCCHN, defined as <1% of tumor cells expressing 
PD-L1, and 57% (149/260) had PD-L1 positive SCCHN, defined as ≥1% of tumor cells 
expressing PD-L1. In pre-specified exploratory subgroup analyses, the hazard ratio for 
survival was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.45) with median survivals of 5.7 and 5.8 months for 
the nivolumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively, in the PD-L1 negative subgroup. 
The HR for survival was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.83) with median survivals of 8.7 and 
4.6 months for the nivolumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively, in the PD-L1 positive  
SCCHN subgroup.OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)14.10 Urothelial Carcinoma
Adjuvant Treatment of UC at High Risk of Recurrence
CHECKMATE-274 (NCT02632409) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study of adjuvant OPDIVO in patients who were within 120 days of radical resection 
(R0) of UC of the bladder or upper urinary tract (renal pelvis or ureter) at high risk 
of recurrence. High risk of recurrence was defined as either 1) ypT2-ypT4a or ypN+ 
for patients who received neoadjuvant cisplatin or 2) pT3-pT4a or pN+ for patients who 
did not receive neoadjuvant cisplatin and who also either were ineligible for or refused 
adjuvant cisplatin. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive OPDIVO 240 mg or placebo 
by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until recurrence or until unacceptable toxicity for 
a maximum treatment duration of 1 year. Patients were stratified by pathologic nodal 
status (N + vs. N0/x with <10 nodes removed vs. N0 with ≥10 nodes removed), tumor 
cells expressing PD-L1 (≥1% vs. <1%/indeterminate as determined by the central lab 
using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay), and use of neoadjuvant cisplatin (yes vs. no).
The trial population characteristics were: median age of 67 years (range: 30 to 92); 76% 
male; 76% White, 22% Asian, 0.7% Black, and 0.1% American Indian or Alaska Native. 
Of the 335 (47%) of patients with node-positive UC, 44 (6%) had non–muscle-invasive 
(<pT2) primary tumors. ECOG performance status was 0 (63%), 1 (35%), or 2 (2%). 
Prior neoadjuvant cisplatin had been given to 43% of patients; of the 57% who did 
not receive prior neoadjuvant cisplatin, reasons listed were ineligibility (22%), patient 
preference (33%), and other/not reported (2%). Tumor PD-L1 expression was ≥1% in 
40% of patients, and 21% of patients had upper tract UC.
The major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed DFS in all 
randomized patients and in patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 ≥1%. DFS was 
defined as time to first recurrence (local urothelial tract, local non-urothelial tract, or 
distant metastasis), or death. Additional efficacy outcome measures included OS.
At the pre-specified interim analysis, CHECKMATE-274 demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in DFS for patients randomized to OPDIVO vs. placebo in the all 
randomized patient population, as well as in the subpopulation of patients with PD-L1 
≥1%, as shown in Table 69 and Figure 20.
In exploratory subgroup analyses in patients with upper tract UC (n = 149), no 
improvement in DFS was observed in the nivolumab arm compared to the placebo arm. 
The unstratified DFS hazard ratio estimate was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.80).
In an exploratory subgroup analysis in patients with PD-L1 expression of <1% (n = 414), 
the unstratified DFS hazard ratio estimate was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.08).
OS data is immature with 33% of deaths in the overall randomized population. 
In the UTUC subpopulation, 37 deaths occurred (20 in the nivolumab arm, 17 in the 
placebo arm).

First-line Treatment of Unresectable or Metastatic UC
CHECKMATE-901 (NCT 03036098) was a randomized, open-label study in patients with  
previously untreated unresectable or metastatic UC. Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
chemotherapy were permitted as long as the disease recurrence took place ≥12 months 
from completion of therapy. Patients who were ineligible for cisplatin and those with 
active CNS metastases were excluded. Stratification factors for randomization were 
PD-L1 status (≥1% vs. <1% or indeterminate) and liver metastasis. Patients were 
randomized 1:1 to receive either:
• OPDIVO 360 mg and cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on Day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on  
Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle of a 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles followed by  
single-agent OPDIVO 480 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, 
OPDIVO was continued for up to 2 years from first dose.
• Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on Day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day  
cycle for up to 6 cycles, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
The major efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR using 
RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR as assessed by BICR.
The median age was 65 years of age (range: 32 to 86) with 51% of patients ≥65 years 
of age and 12% of patients ≥75 years of age, 23% were Asian, 72% were White, 0.3% 
were Black, 0.3% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 4.9% were Other, 12% were  
Hispanic or Latino, and 77% were male. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (53%)  
or 1 (46%). At baseline, 87% of patients had metastatic UC, including 20% with liver 
metastases, 11% had locally advanced UC, and 51% had UC histologic variants. 
Forty-nine (16%) in the OPDIVO in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy 
arm and 43 (14%) in the cisplatin-based chemotherapy arm switched from cisplatin to 
carboplatin after at least one cycle of cisplatin.

Previously Treated Advanced or Metastatic UC
CHECKMATE-275 (NCT02387996) was a single-arm trial in 270 patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic UC who had disease progression during or following platinum-
containing chemotherapy or who had disease progression within 12 months of treatment 
with a platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Patients 
were excluded for active brain or leptomeningeal metastases, active autoimmune 
disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, and ECOG 
performance status >1. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 
2 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or either radiographic or clinical progression. Tumor 
response assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 48 weeks and every 
12 weeks thereafter. Major efficacy outcome measures included confirmed ORR as 
assessed by IRRC using RECIST v1.1 and DOR.
The median age was 66 years (range: 38 to 90), 78% were male, 86% were White. 
Twenty-seven percent had non-bladder urothelial carcinoma and 84% had visceral 
metastases. Thirty-four percent of patients had disease progression following prior 
platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Twenty-nine percent of patients 
had received ≥2 prior systemic regimens in the metastatic setting. Thirty-six percent of 
patients received prior cisplatin only, 23% received prior carboplatin only, and 7% were 
treated with both cisplatin and carboplatin in the metastatic setting. Forty-six percent 
of patients had an ECOG performance status of 1. Eighteen percent of patients had a 
hemoglobin <10 g/dL, and twenty-eight percent of patients had liver metastases at 
baseline. Patients were included regardless of their PD-L1 status.
Tumor specimens were evaluated prospectively using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx 
assay at a central laboratory and the results were used to define subgroups 
for pre-specified analyses. Of the 270 patients, 46% were defined as having 
PD-L1 expression of ≥1% (defined as ≥1% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1). 
The remaining 54% of patients were classified as having PD-L1 expression of 
<1% (defined as <1% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1). Confirmed ORR in all patients 
and the two PD-L1 subgroups are shown in Table 71. Median time to response was 
1.9 months (range: 1.6-7.2). In 77 patients who received prior systemic therapy only 
in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, the ORR was 23.4% (95% CI: 14.5%, 34.4%).

Colorectal Cancer
CHECKMATE-142 (NCT02060188) was a multicenter, non-randomized, multiple 
parallel-cohort, open-label trial conducted in patients with locally determined dMMR 
or MSI-H metastatic CRC (mCRC) who had disease progression during or after prior 
treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, or irinotecan-based chemotherapy.  
Key eligibility criteria were at least one prior line of treatment for metastatic 
disease, ECOG performance status 0 or 1, and absence of the following: active brain 
metastases, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic 
immunosuppression.
Patients enrolled in the single agent OPDIVO MSI-H mCRC cohort received OPDIVO 
3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion (IV) every 2 weeks. Patients enrolled in the OPDIVO 
and ipilimumab MSI-H mCRC cohort received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by OPDIVO as a single agent at a dose 
of 3 mg/kg as intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. Treatment in both cohorts continued 
until unacceptable toxicity or radiographic progression.
Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 
12 weeks thereafter. Efficacy outcome measures included ORR and DOR as assessed 
by BICR using RECIST v1.1.
A total of 74 patients were enrolled in the single-agent MSI-H mCRC OPDIVO cohort. 
The median age was 53 years (range: 26 to 79) with 23% ≥65 years of age and 5% 
≥75 years of age, 59% were male and 88% were White. Baseline ECOG performance 
status was 0 (43%), 1 (55%), or 3 (1.4%) and 36% were reported to have Lynch 
Syndrome. Across the 74 patients, 72% received prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, 
oxaliplatin, and irinotecan; 7%, 30%, 28%, 19%, and 16% received 0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 prior 
lines of therapy for metastatic disease, respectively, and 42% of patients had received 
an anti-EGFR antibody.
A total of 119 patients were enrolled in the OPDIVO and ipilimumab MSI-H mCRC cohort. 
The median age was 58 years (range: 21 to 88), with 32% ≥65 years of age and 9% 
≥75 years of age; 59% were male and 92% were White. Baseline ECOG performance 
status was 0 (45%) and 1 (55%), and 29% were reported to have Lynch Syndrome. 
Across the 119 patients, 69% had received prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, 
oxaliplatin, and irinotecan; 10%, 40%, 24%, and 15% received 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 prior 
lines of therapy for metastatic disease, respectively, and 29% had received an 
anti-EGFR antibody.
Efficacy results for each of these single-arm cohorts are shown in Table 72.

14.12 Hepatocellular Carcinoma
CHECKMATE-040 (NCT01658878) was a multicenter, multiple cohort, open-label trial that 
evaluated the efficacy of OPDIVO as a single agent and in combination with ipilimumab 
in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who progressed on or were intolerant 
to sorafenib. Additional eligibility criteria included histologic confirmation of HCC and 
Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis. The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, 
brain metastasis, a history of hepatic encephalopathy, clinically significant ascites, 
infection with HIV, or active co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) or HBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV); however, patients with only active HBV or HCV 
were eligible.
Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for 48 weeks and then every 
12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed overall 
response rate as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 and modified RECIST (mRECIST) 
for HCC. Duration of response was also assessed.The efficacy of OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab was evaluated in 49 patients 
(Cohort 4) who received OPDIVO 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg administered every 
3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by single-agent OPDIVO at 240 mg every 2 weeks until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 60 years (range: 
18 to 80), 88% were male, 74% were Asian, and 25% were White. Baseline ECOG 
performance status was 0 (61%) or 1 (39%). Fifty-seven (57%) percent of patients had 
active HBV infection, 8% had active HCV infection, and 35% had no evidence of active 
HBV or HCV. The etiology for HCC was alcoholic liver disease in 16% and non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease in 6% of patients. Child-Pugh class and score was A5 for 82% and 
A6 for 18%; 80% of patients had extrahepatic spread; 35% had vascular invasion; and 
51% had AFP levels ≥400 µg/L. Prior cancer treatment history included surgery (74%), 
radiotherapy (29%), or local treatment (59%). All patients had received prior sorafenib, of 
whom 10% were unable to tolerate sorafenib; 29% of patients had received 2 or more 
prior systemic therapies.
Efficacy results are shown in Table 73. The results for OPDIVO in combination with 
ipilimumab in Cohort 4 are based on a minimum follow-up of 28 months.

14.13 Esophageal Cancer
Adjuvant Treatment of Resected Esophageal or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
CHECKMATE-577 (NCT02743494) was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind 
trial in 794 patients with completely resected (negative margins) esophageal or 
gastroesophageal junction cancer who had residual pathologic disease following 
concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either 
OPDIVO 240 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 
16 weeks followed by 480 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 
4 weeks beginning at week 17. Treatment was until disease recurrence, unacceptable 
toxicity, or for up to 1 year in total duration. Enrollment required complete resection 
within 4 to 16 weeks prior to randomization. The trial excluded patients who did not 
receive CRT prior to surgery, had stage IV resectable disease, autoimmune disease, or 
any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (>10 mg daily 
prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications. Randomization 
was stratified by tumor PD-L1 status (≥1% vs. <1% or indeterminate or non-evaluable), 
pathologic lymph node status (positive ≥ypN1 vs. negative ypN0), and histology 
(squamous vs. adenocarcinoma). The major efficacy outcome measure was disease-free 
survival (DFS) defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of 
first recurrence (local, regional, or distant from the primary resected site) or death, from 
any cause, whichever occurred first as assessed by the investigator prior to subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy. Patients on treatment underwent imaging for tumor recurrence 
every 12 weeks for 2 years, and a minimum of one scan every 6 to 12 months for 
years 3 to 5.
The trial population characteristics were: median age 62 years (range: 26 to 86), 36% 
were ≥65 years of age, 85% were male, 15% were Asian, 82% were White, and 1.1% 
were Black. Disease characteristics were AJCC Stage II (35%) or Stage III (65%) at 
initial diagnosis carcinoma, EC (60%) or GEJC (40%) at initial diagnosis, with pathologic 
positive lymph node status (58%) at study entry and histological confirmation of 
predominant adenocarcinoma (71%) or squamous cell carcinoma (29%). The baseline 
Tumor PD-L1 status ≥1% was positive for 16% of patients and negative for 72% of 
patients. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (58%) or 1 (42%).
CHECKMATE-577 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in DFS for  
patients randomized to the OPDIVO arm as compared with the placebo arm. DFS benefit 
was observed regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression and histology.

CHECKMATE-648 (NCT03143153) was a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial 
in patients with previously untreated unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic 
ESCC (squamous or adenosquamous histology). The trial enrolled patients whose tumor 
was evaluable for tumor cell (TC) PD-L1 expression [also called PD-L1 tumor proportion 
score (TPS)], which was evaluated using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central 
laboratory. A retrospective scoring of a patient’s tumor PD-L1 status using Combined 
Positive Score (CPS), was also conducted using the PD-L1-stained tumor specimens 
used for randomization. Patients were not amenable to chemoradiation or surgery with 
curative intent. Prior treatment with curative intent was allowed if completed more than 
six months prior to trial enrollment. The trial excluded patients with brain metastasis 
that were symptomatic, had active autoimmune disease, used systemic corticosteroids 
or immunosuppressants, or patients at high risk of bleeding or fistula due to apparent 
invasion of tumor to organs adjacent to the esophageal tumor. Patients were randomized 
to receive one of the following treatments:
• OPDIVO 240 mg on days 1 and 15, fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day intravenously  
on days 1 through 5 (for 5 days), and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 
(of a 4-week cycle).
• OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 
6 weeks.
• Fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day intravenously on days 1 through 5 (for 5 days), and 
cisplatin 80 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 (of a 4-week cycle).
Patients received OPDIVO until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 
2 years. In patients who received OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy and in 
whom either fluorouracil and/or cisplatin were discontinued, other components of the 
treatment regimen were allowed to be continued. Patients who discontinued combination 
therapy because of an adverse reaction attributed to ipilimumab were permitted to 
continue OPDIVO as a single agent.
Randomization was stratified by TC PD-L1 expression (≥1% vs. <1% or indeterminate), 
region (East Asia vs. Rest of Asia vs. Rest of World), ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1),  
and number of organs with metastases (≤1 vs. ≥2). The major efficacy outcome 
measures were OS and BICR-assessed PFS in patients with TC PD-L1 expression ≥1%. 
Additional efficacy measures included OS in all randomized patients, BICR-assessed PFS 
in all randomized patients, and ORR assessed by BICR in TC PD-L1 expression ≥1% and 
in all randomized patients. The tumor assessments per RECIST v1.1 were conducted 
every 6 weeks up to and including week 48, then every 12 weeks thereafter.
A total of 970 patients were randomized in CHECKMATE-648 study among whom 965 
and 906 patients had quantifiable TC PD-L1 expression and CPS at baseline, respectively. 
The trial population characteristics for all randomized patients were median age 64 years 
(range: 26 to 90), 47% were ≥65 years of age, 82% were male, 71% were Asian, 
26% were White, and 1.1% were Black or African American. Patients had histological 
confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma (98%) or adenosquamous cell carcinoma 
(1.9%) in the esophagus. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (47.0%) or 1 (53%).
Efficacy results are shown in Table 75 and Figure 24 and 25.

0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0OPDIVO® (nivolumab)Exploratory subgroup analyses of patients with TC PD-L1 expression <1% (n = 492) were 
conducted. OS results for each OPDIVO containing arm compared to chemotherapy were:
• OPDIVO with Chemotherapy (n = 163) vs. Chemotherapy (n = 165): unstratified 
OS HR was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.29) with median OS of 12 months (95% CI:  
9.9, 15.5) on the OPDIVO with Chemotherapy arm and 12.2 months (95% CI:  
10.7, 14) on the Chemotherapy arm.
• OPDIVO with Ipilimumab (n = 164) vs. Chemotherapy (n = 165): unstratified OS 
HR was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.26) with median OS of 12 months (95% CI:  
10.1, 16.0) on the OPDIVO with Ipilimumab arm and 12.2 months (95% CI:  
10.7, 14) on the Chemotherapy arm.
Exploratory subgroup analyses were also conducted by PD-L1 status per CPS (≥1 and <1)  
for each OPDIVO containing arm compared to chemotherapy. Among the 906 patients 
with quantifiable PD-L1 CPS at baseline, 278 in the OPDIVO with chemotherapy arm, 
266 in the OPDIVO with Ipilimumab arm, and 280 in the chemotherapy arm had PD-L1 
CPS ≥1. A total of 27 patients in the OPDIVO with chemotherapy arm, 31 patients in  
the OPDIVO with Ipilimumab arm, and 24 patients in the chemotherapy arm had 
PD-L1 CPS <1.
OS results for each comparison by PD-L1 CPS status were:
• OPDIVO with Chemotherapy vs. Chemotherapy: unstratified OS HR was 0.69 
(95% CI: 0.56, 0.84) for PD-L1 CPS ≥1 subgroup and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.95) 
for PD-L1 CPS <1 subgroup.
• OPDIVO with Ipilimumab vs. Chemotherapy: unstratified OS HR was 0.76 (95% CI:  
0.62, 0.93) for PD-L1 CPS ≥1 subgroup and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.94) for PD-L1 
CPS <1 subgroup.
Previously Treated Unresectable Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Esophageal 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)
ATTRACTION-3 (NCT02569242) was a multicenter, randomized (1:1), active-controlled, 
open-label trial in patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent, or metastatic ESCC, 
who were refractory or intolerant to at least one fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based 
regimen. The trial enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 status, but tumor specimens 
were evaluated prospectively using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central 
laboratory. The trial excluded patients who were refractory or intolerant to taxane 
therapy, had brain metastases that were symptomatic or required treatment, had 
autoimmune disease, used systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, or had 
apparent tumor invasion of organs adjacent to the esophageal tumor or had stents in the 
esophagus or respiratory tract. Patients were randomized to receive OPDIVO 240 mg by 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks or investigator’s choice of taxane 
chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks) or 
paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 intravenously once a week for 6 weeks followed by 1 week off).
Randomization was stratified by region (Japan vs. Rest of World), number of organs with 
metastases (≤1 vs. ≥2), and PD-L1 status (≥1% vs. <1% or indeterminate). Patients 
were treated until disease progression, assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, or 
unacceptable toxicity. The tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for 1 year, 
and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional 
efficacy outcome measures were ORR and PFS as assessed by the investigator using 
RECIST v1.1 and DOR.
A total of 419 patients were randomized; 210 to the OPDIVO arm and 209 to the 
investigator’s choice arm (docetaxel: 31%, paclitaxel: 69%). The trial population 
characteristics were: median age 65 years (range: 33 to 87), 53% were ≥65 years 
of age, 87% were male, 96% were Asian and 4% were White. Sixty-seven percent of 
patients had received one prior systemic therapy regimen and 26% had received two 
prior systemic therapy regimens prior to enrolling in ATTRACTION-3. Baseline ECOG 
performance status was 0 (50%) or 1 (50%).
ATTRACTION-3 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients 
randomized to OPDIVO as compared with investigator’s choice of taxane chemotherapy. 
OS benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The minimum follow-up 
was 17.6 months. Efficacy results are shown in Table 76 and Figure 26.

Of the 419 patients, 48% had PD-L1 positive ESCC, defined as ≥1% of tumor cells 
expressing PD-L1. The remaining 52% had PD-L1 negative ESCC defined as <1% of 
tumor cells expressing PD-L1.
In a pre-specified exploratory analysis by PD-L1 status, the hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 
0.69 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.94) with median survivals of 10.9 and 8.1 months for the OPDIVO 
and investigator’s choice arms, respectively, in the PD-L1 positive subgroup. In the PD-L1 
negative subgroup, the HR for OS was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.14) with median survivals 
of 10.9 and 9.3 months for the OPDIVO and investigator’s choice arms, respectively.
14.14 Gastric Cancer, Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer, and Esophageal 
Adenocarcinoma
CHECKMATE-649 (NCT02872116) was a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial 
in patients (n = 1581) with previously untreated advanced or metastatic gastric 
cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The trial 
enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 status, and tumor specimens were evaluated 
prospectively using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central laboratory. The trial 
excluded patients who were known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
positive, or had untreated CNS metastases. Patients were randomized to receive OPDIVO 
in combination with chemotherapy (n = 789) or chemotherapy (n = 792). Patients received 
one of the following treatments:
• OPDIVO 240 mg in combination with mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and 
oxaliplatin) every 2 weeks or mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks.
• OPDIVO 360 mg in combination with CapeOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) every 
3 weeks or CapeOX every 3 weeks.
Patients were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 2 years. 
In patients who received OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy and in whom 
chemotherapy was discontinued, OPDIVO monotherapy was allowed to be given at 
240 mg every 2 weeks, 360 mg every 3 weeks, or 480 mg every 4 weeks up to 2 years 
after treatment initiation.(Continued)OPDIVO® (nivolumab) OPDIVO® (nivolumab)Randomization was stratified by tumor cell PD-L1 status (≥1% vs. <1% or indeterminate),  
region (Asia vs. US vs. Rest of World), ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), and 
chemotherapy regimen (mFOLFOX6 vs. CapeOX). The major efficacy outcome measures, 
assessed in patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥5, were PFS assessed by BICR and OS. Additional 
efficacy outcome measures included OS and PFS in patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 and in 
all randomized patients, and ORR and DOR as assessed by BICR in patients with PD-L1 
CPS ≥1 and ≥5, and in all randomized patients. Tumor assessments were conducted per  
RECIST v1.1 every 6 weeks up to and including week 48, then every 12 weeks thereafter.
The trial population characteristics were: median age 61 years (range: 18 to 90),  
39% were ≥65 years of age, 70% were male, 24% were Asian, and 69% were White, and

What is the most important information I should know about OPDIVO?
OPDIVO is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system. OPDIVO can cause your 
immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These 
problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. These problems may happen anytime 
during treatment or even after your treatment has ended. You may have more than one of these problems at the same time. 
Some of these problems may happen more often when OPDIVO is used in combination with another therapy.
Call or see your healthcare provider right away if you develop any new or worsening signs or symptoms, including:
Lung problems.
 ●cough  ●shortness of breath  ●chest pain
Intestinal problems.
 ●diarrhea (loose stools) or more frequent bowel movements than usual
 ●stools that are black, tarry, sticky, or have blood or mucus
 ●severe stomach-area (abdominal) pain or tenderness
Liver problems.

Problems can also happen in other organs and tissues. These are not all of the signs and symptoms of immune 
system problems that can happen with OPDIVO. Call or see your healthcare provider right away for any new or 
worsening signs or symptoms, which may include:
 ●chest pain, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath or swelling of ankles
 ●confusion, sleepiness, memory problems, changes in mood or behavior, stiff neck, balance problems, tingling or 
numbness of the arms or legs

Rejection of a transplanted organ or tissue.  Your healthcare provider should tell you what signs and symptoms you 
should report and monitor you depending on the type of organ transplant that you have had.
Getting medical treatment right away may help keep these problems from becoming more serious.  Your healthcare 
provider will check you for these problems during treatment with OPDIVO. Your healthcare provider may treat you with 
corticosteroid or hormone replacement medicines. Your healthcare provider may also need to delay or completely stop 
treatment with OPDIVO, if you have severe side effects.
