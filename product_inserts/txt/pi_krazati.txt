5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions
KRAZATI can cause severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], who received single-agent 
KRAZATI, serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions observed were gastrointestinal KRAZATI® (adagrasib) KRAZATI® (adagrasib)bleeding in 3.8% including 0.8% Grade 3 or 4, gastrointestinal obstruction in 1.6% including  
1.4% Grade 3 or 4, colitis in 0.5% including 0.3% Grade 3, ileus in 0.5%, and stenosis in 
0.3%. In addition, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting occurred in 89% of 366 patients, including 
9% Grade 3. Nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting led to dosage interruption or dose reduction in 
29% of patients and permanent discontinuation of adagrasib in 0.3%.
In patients who received KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab [see Adverse Reactions 
(6.1)], serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions included gastrointestinal bleeding in 8.5% 
including 1.1% Grade 3 or 4, gastrointestinal obstruction in 5.3% including 5.3% Grade 3 
or 4, colitis in 1.1% including 1.1% Grade 3 and ileus in 1.1%. In addition, nausea, diarrhea, 
or vomiting occurred in 92% of 94 patients, including 6% Grade 3. Nausea, diarrhea, or 
vomiting led to adagrasib dose interruption or dose reduction in 23% of patients.
Monitor and manage patients using supportive care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, 
or fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue 
KRAZATI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
5.2 QTc Interval Prolongation
KRAZATI can cause QTc interval prolongation, which can increase the risk for ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias (e.g., torsades de pointes) or sudden death.
In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6. 1)] who received single-agent 
KRAZATI, 6% of 366 patients with at least one post-baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) 
assessment had an average QTc ≥501 msec and 11% of patients had an increase from 
baseline of QTc >60 msec. KRAZATI causes concentration-dependent increases in the QTc 
interval [see Clinical Pharmacolog y (12.2)].
In patients who received KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab [see Adverse Reactions 
(6.1)], 5% of 93 patients with at least one post-baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) 
assessment had an average QTc ≥501 msec and 16% of patients had an increase from 
baseline of QTc >60 msec.
Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products with a known potential to prolong 
the QTc interval [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Avoid use 
of KRAZATI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with concurrent 
QTc prolongation.
Monitor ECGs and electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, prior to starting 
KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated in patients with congestive 
heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients who are unable 
to avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong the QT interval. Correct 
electrolyte abnormalities. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI 
depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
5.3 Hepatotoxicity
KRAZATI can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and 
hepatitis.
In the pooled safety population of 366 patients [see Adverse Reactions (6. 1)] who received 
single-agent KRAZATI, drug-induced liver injury was reported in 0.3% of patients, 
including 0.3% Grade 3. A total of 32% of patients who received adagrasib had increased 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST); 5% were 
Grade 3 and 0.5% were Grade 4. The median time to first onset of increased ALT/AST  
was 3 weeks (range: 0.1 to 48). Overall hepatotoxicity occurred in 37%, and 7% were 
Grade 3 or 4. Hepatotoxicity leading to dose interruption or reduction occurred in 12% of 
patients. Adagrasib was discontinued due to hepatotoxicity in 0.5% of patients.
In patients who received KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab [see Adverse 
Reactions (6.1)], 29% had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST); 5% were Grade 3 and 1.1% were Grade 4. The median time to 
first onset of increased ALT/AST was 4 weeks (range: 0.1 to 27). Overall hepatotoxicity 
occurred in 38%, and 10% were Grade 3 or 4. Hepatotoxicity leading to adagrasib dose 
interruption or reduction occurred in 12% of patients.
Monitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin) prior to the 
start of KRAZATI and monthly for 3 months or as clinically indicated, with more frequent 
testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Reduce the dose, withhold, or 
permanently discontinue KRAZATI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) 
and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
5.4 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis
KRAZATI can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, which can be fatal.
In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6. 1)] who received single-agent 
KRAZATI, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 4.1% of patients, 1.4% were Grade 3 or 4, and one 
case was fatal. The median time to first onset for ILD/pneumonitis was 12 weeks (range: 
5 to 31 weeks). Adagrasib was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.8% of patients.
In patients who received KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab [see Adverse Reactions 
(6.1)], Grade 1 ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.1% of patients. The time to first onset for ILD/
pneumonitis was 38 weeks.
Monitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis 
(e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever) during treatment with KRAZATI. Withhold KRAZATI in patients 
with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue KRAZATI if no other 
potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the  
labeling:
• Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
• QTc Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
• Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on KRAZATI
Strong CYP3A4 Inducers
Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with strong CYP3A inducers.
Adagrasib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of KRAZATI with a strong CYP3A 
inducer reduces adagrasib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may 
reduce the effectiveness of KRAZATI.
Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors
Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with strong CYP3A inhibitors until adagrasib 
concentrations have reached steady state (after approximately 8 days).
Adagrasib is a CYP3A4 substrate. If adagrasib concentrations have not reached steady 
state, concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor will increase adagrasib concentrations, 
[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of KRAZATI adverse 
reactions.
7.2 Effects of KRAZATI on Other Drugs
Sensitive CYP3A Substrates
Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with sensitive CYP3A substrates unless otherwise 
recommended in the Prescribing Information for these substrates.
Adagrasib is a CYP3A inhibitor. Concomitant use with KRAZATI increases exposure of 
CYP3A substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of 
adverse reactions related to these substrates.
Sensitive CYP2C9 Substrates
Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with sensitive CYP2C9 substrates where minimal 
concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions unless otherwise 
recommended in the Prescribing Information for these substrates.
Adagrasib is a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Concomitant use with KRAZATI increases exposure of 
CYP2C9 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of 
adverse reactions related to these substrates.
Sensitive CYP2D6 Substrates
Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with sensitive CYP2D6 substrates where minimal 
concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions unless otherwise 
recommended in the Prescribing Information for these substrates.
Adagrasib is a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Concomitant use with KRAZATI increases exposure of 
CYP2D6 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of 
adverse reactions related to these substrates.
P-gp Substrates
Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with P-gp substrates where minimal concentration 
changes may lead to serious adverse reactions unless otherwise recommended in the 
Prescribing Information for these substrates.
Adagrasib is a P-gp inhibitor. Concomitant use with KRAZATI increases exposure of P-gp 
substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse 
reactions related to these substrates.7.3 Drugs That Prolong QTc Interval
Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other product(s) with a known potential to prolong 
the QTc interval. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor electrocardiogram and 
electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated 
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Withhold KRAZATI if the QTc interval is >500 ms or 
the change from baseline is >60 ms [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
Adagrasib causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 
Concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products that prolong the QTc interval may result 
in a greater increase in the QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc 
interval prolongation, including Torsade de pointes, other serious arrythmias, and sudden 
death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Risk Summary
There are no available data on the use of KRAZATI in pregnant women. In animal 
reproduction studies, oral administration of adagrasib to pregnant rats and rabbits during 
the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse development effects or embryo-fetal 
lethality at exposures below the human exposure at the recommended dose of 600 mg 
twice daily ( see Data).
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects 
and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, 
respectively.
Data
Animal Data
In a rat embryo-fetal development study, once daily oral administration of adagrasib to 
pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity (reduced 
body weight and food intake, and adverse clinical signs leading to moribund condition and 
early termination) and lower fetal body weight at 270 mg/kg dose level (approximately 2 
times the recommended dose of 600 mg twice daily based on body surface area [BSA]). 
Adagrasib induced skeletal malformations, such as bent limbs, and skeletal variations, 
such as bent scapula, wavy ribs, and supernumerary short cervical ribs at 270 mg/kg, 
which were secondary to maternal toxicity and reduced fetal body weight.
In a rabbit embryo-fetal development study, once daily oral administration of adagrasib 
during the period of organogenesis resulted in lower fetal body weight and increased 
litter frequency of unossified sternebra at 30 mg/kg (approximately 0.11 times the human 
exposure based on area under the curve [AUC] at the clinical dose of 600 mg twice daily). 
This skeletal variation was associated with maternal toxicities, including reduced mean 
body weight and decreased food consumption. Adagrasib exposure did not cause adverse 
developmental effects and did not affect embryo-fetal survival in rabbits at doses up to 
30 mg/kg once daily.
8.2 Lactation
Risk Summary
There are no data on the presence of adagrasib or its metabolites in human milk, the 
effects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment 
with KRAZATI and for 1 week after the last dose.
8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
Infertility
Based on findings from animal studies, KRAZATI may impair fertility in females and males 
of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicolog y (13.1)].
8.4 Pediatric Use
The safety and effectiveness of KRAZATI has not been established in pediatric patients.
8.5 Geriatric Use
Of 116 patients with metastatic NSCLC who received adagrasib 600 mg orally twice daily 
in KRYSTAL-1, 49% (57 patients) were ≥65 years of age and 13% (15 patients) were 
≥75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between 
older and younger patients.
Of 94 patients with metastatic CRC who received adagrasib 600 mg orally twice daily in 
combination with cetuximab in KRISTAL-1, 33% (31 patients) were ≥65 years of age and 
2.1% (2 patients) were ≥75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness 
were observed between older and younger patients.KRAZATI® (adagrasib) KRAZATI® (adagrasib)11 DESCRIPTION
Adagrasib is an irreversible inhibitor of KR AS G12C and belongs to the RAS GTPase family. 
The molecular formula is C 32H35C1FN 7O2 and the molecular weight is 604.1 g/mol. The 
chemical name is {(2 S)-4-[7-(8-chloronaphthalen-1-yl)-2-{[(2 S)-1-methylpyrrolidin-2-
yl]-methoxy}-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[3,4- d]pyrimidin-4-yl]-1-(2-fluoroprop-2-enoyl)
piperazin-2-yl}acetonitrile. Adagrasib has the following chemical structure:
O
OF
NN
NNNNNC
CI
Adagrasib is a crystalline solid. The solubility of adagrasib in the aqueous media decreases 
over the range pH 1.2 to 7.4 from >262 mg/mL to < 0.010 mg/mL.
KRAZATI (adagrasib) tablets for oral administration contain 200 mg of adagrasib. The 
following are inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium 
stearate (vegetable sourced), mannitol, and microcrystalline cellulose. The tablet film 
coating contains hypromellose, maltodextrin, medium chain triglycerides (vegetable 
sourced), polydextrose, talc, and titanium dioxide.
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
Adagrasib is an irreversible inhibitor of K RAS G12C that covalently binds to the mutant 
cysteine in KR AS G12C and locks the mutant KR AS protein in its inactive state that 
prevents downstream signaling without affecting wild-type KR AS protein. Adagrasib 
inhibited tumor cell growth and viability in cells harboring KRAS G12C mutations and 
resulted in tumor regression in KRAS G12C-mutated tumor xenograft models with minimal 
off-target activity. Adagrasib in combination with cetuximab had increased antitumor 
activity in some cell line-derived and patient-derived KRAS G12C-mutant CRC tumor 
xenograft models compared to adagrasib or cetuximab alone.
12.2 Pharmacodynamics
Adagrasib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic 
response are unknown.
Cardiac Electrophysiology
Adagrasib increased QTc in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on the 
concentration-QTcF relationship, the mean (90% CI) QTcF change from baseline (ΔQTcF) 
was 18 (15, 21) ms at the mean steady-state maximum concentration (C max,ss) in patients 
after administration of adagrasib 600 mg twice daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
12.3 Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of adagrasib were studied in healthy subjects and in patients with 
KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC or CRC. Adagrasib pharmacokinetic data are presented as 
mean (percent coefficient of variation) unless otherwise specified.
Adagrasib AUC and C max increase dose proportionally over the dose range of 400 mg to 
600 mg (0.67 to 1 times the approved recommended dose). Adagrasib steady-state was 
reached within 8 days following administration of the approved recommended dosage and 
accumulation was approximately 6-fold.
Absorption
The median (min, max) T max of adagrasib is approximately 6 (6, 12) hours.
Effect of Food
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of adagrasib were observed 
following administration of a high-fat and high-calorie meal (containing approximately 900 
to 1000 calories, 50% from fat).
Distribution
The apparent volume of distribution of adagrasib is 942 L (57%). Human plasma protein 
binding of adagrasib is approximately 98% in vitro.
Elimination
The adagrasib terminal elimination half-life is 23 hours (16%) and the apparent oral 
clearance (CL/F) is 37 L/h (54%) in patients.
Metabolism
Adagrasib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 following single dose administration. 
Adagrasib inhibits its own CYP3A4 metabolism following multiple dosing to steady-state 
which permits CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 to contribute to its 
metabolism at steady-state.
Excretion
Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled adagrasib, approximately 75% of the dose was 
recovered in feces (14% as unchanged) and 4.5% recovered in urine (2% as unchanged).Specific Populations
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of adagrasib based on age 
(19 to 89 years), sex, race (White, Black or African American, or Asian), body weight  
(36 to 146 kg), ECOG PS (0, 1), tumor type (NSCLC or CRC), or tumor burden. No clinically 
significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of adagrasib are expected in patients with 
mild to severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to <90 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault 
equation) or in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A to C).

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with adagrasib.
Adagrasib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and 
was not genotoxic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay or an in vivo micronucleus 
assay in rats.
Fertility studies were not conducted with adagrasib. In toxicology studies of up to 
13-weeks in duration in rats, oral administration of adagrasib induced phospholipidosis 
which increased vacuolation in female reproductive organs, including vacuolation in 
ovaries (corpora lutea, macrophage or interstitial cells) and uterus (glandular epithelium), 
and atrophy with mucification of the vaginal mucosa at doses ≥150 mg/kg (approximately 
equal to or greater than the human exposure at the recommended dose based on area KRAZATI® (adagrasib) KRAZATI® (adagrasib)under the curve [AUC]). These findings reversed after cessation of dosing in the 28-day 
study but in the 13-week study, pigmented macrophage aggregates were observed in the 
ovaries of female rats after the recovery period. In a 28-day repeat-dose toxicology study, 
oral administration of adagrasib to male rats induced atrophy and epithelial vacuolation 
of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles at 300 mg/kg (approximately 1.6 times the 
human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC). These findings resolved after 
cessation of treatment.
13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology
Phospholipidosis (vacuolation and/or presence of foamy macrophages) was observed 
in multiple organs (e.g., lung, trachea, heart, skeletal, ovaries, uterus, adrenal gland, 
kidney, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and thyroid in rats; and heart and lung in dogs) 
after repeated oral administration of adagrasib in rats and dogs. In toxicology studies of 
up to 13-week duration in rats, phospholipidosis was observed at doses ≥150 mg/kg 
(approximately ≥2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC).  
In a dog 28-day toxicity study, this effect was observed at 25 mg/kg (approximately 
equal to the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC). The extent of 
vacuolization and the presence of foamy macrophages were more prominent in the rat 
compared to dogs, and evidence of reversibility after cessation of treatment was noted for 
most organs. The significance of this finding in humans in unknown.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
14.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The efficacy of adagrasib was evaluated in KRYSTAL-1 (NCT03785249), a multicenter, 
single-arm, open-label expansion cohort study. Eligible patients were required to have 
locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who previously received 
treatment with a platinum-based regimen and an immune checkpoint inhibitor, an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and at 
least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST v1.1). Identification of a KRAS G12C mutation was prospectively determined by 
local testing using tissue specimens. Patients received adagrasib 600 mg orally twice daily 
until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor assessments were performed 
every 6 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed objective response 
rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as evaluated by blinded independent central 
review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1.
In the efficacy population, KRAS G12C mutation status was determined by prospective 
local testing using tumor tissue specimens. Of the 112 patients with KRAS G12C mutation, 
tissue samples from 88% (98/112) patients were tested retrospectively using the QIAGEN 
therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit. While 89% (87/98) of patients were positive for KRAS  
G12C mutation, 11% (11/98) did not have a KRAS  G12C mutation identified. In addition, 
plasma samples from 63% (71/112) patients were tested retrospectively using Agilent 
Resolution ctDx FIRST assay. While 66% (47/71) of patients were positive for KRAS G12C 
mutation, 34% (24/71) did not have a KRAS G12C mutation identified.
A total of 112 patients had at least one measurable lesion at baseline as assessed by BICR 
according to RECIST v1.1.
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics in the efficacy population were: 
median age 64 years (range: 25 to 89), 55% female, 83% White, 8% were Black or African 
American, 4% Asian, 4% race not reported, 0.9% American Indian or Alaska Native,  
16% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 and 
83% ECOG PS 1. Tumor histology was 97% adenocarcinoma and 89% of patients had 
metastatic disease. Patients received a median of 2 prior systemic therapies (range 1 
to 7); 43% received 1 prior line, 35% received 2 prior lines, 10% received 3 prior lines  
and 12% received 4 or more prior lines, 98% received both prior platinum and prior 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Sites of extra-thoracic disease included bone 42%, brain 30%, 
adrenals 21%, and liver 21%.

14.2 Colorectal Cancer
The efficacy of adagrasib in combination with cetuximab was evaluated in KRYSTAL-1, a 
multicenter, single-arm, open-label expansion cohort study. Eligible patients were required 
to have locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated CRC and to have previously received therapy with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, 
a VEGF inhibitor if eligible, and an ECOG PS of 0 or 1.
Patients initiated treatment with adagrasib 600 mg orally twice daily in combination 
with cetuximab administered either biweekly (77 patients with 500 mg/m2 every 
two weeks) or weekly (17 patients with 400 mg/m2 initial dose followed by 250 mg/m2 
weekly). Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor 
assessments were performed every 6 weeks. Adagrasib discontinuation required 
cetuximab discontinuation, however patients could continue to receive adagrasib if 
cetuximab was discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Six patients continued 
with adagrasib single agent therapy after discontinuing cetuximab. The length of time 
these 6 patients received adagrasib alone ranged from 43 days to 3 years. Patient 
treatment with adagrasib after disease progression continued if a patient was clinically 
stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. 
The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed ORR and DOR according to RECIST v1.1  
as assessed by BICR. 
In the efficacy population, KRAS G12C mutation status was determined by prospective 
local testing using tumor tissue specimens. Of the 94 patients with KRAS G12C mutation, 
tissue samples from 79% (74/94) patients were tested retrospectively using the QIAGEN 
therascreen KR AS RGQ PCR Kit. Of the 74 tissue samples submitted, 81% (60/74) yielded 
a result with 93% (56/60) positive for KRAS G12C and 7% (4/60) without a KRAS G12C 
mutation identified.
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics in the efficacy population were: 
median age 57 years (range: 24 to 75 years), 53% female, 71% White, 14% were Black or 
African American, 5% Asian, 1.1% American Indian or Alaska Native, 9% reported as other; 
51% ECOG PS 0 and 49% ECOG PS 1. Tumor histology was 100% adenocarcinoma and 
99% of patients had metastatic disease. Patients received a median of 3 prior systemic 
therapies (range 1 to 9); 9% received 1 prior line, 36% received 2 prior lines, 31% received 
3 prior lines and 25% received 4 or more prior lines. Sites of metastatic disease included 
lung (71%), liver (64%) and bone (14%).
