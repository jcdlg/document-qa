WARNING: RISK OF HEART FAILURE
CAMZYOS reduces left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and can cause heart 
failure due to systolic dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Echocardiogram assessments of LVEF are required prior to and during treatment 
with CAMZYOS. Initiation of CAMZYOS in patients with LVEF <55% is not 
recommended. Interrupt CAMZYOS if LVEF is <50% at any visit or if the patient 
experiences heart failure symptoms or worsening clinical status [see Dosage 
and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Concomitant use of CAMZYOS with certain cytochrome P450 inhibitors or 
discontinuation of certain cytochrome P450 inducers may increase the risk 
of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction; therefore, the use of CAMZYOS is 
contraindicated with the following [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and 
Precautions (5.2)]:
• Moderate to strong CYP2C19 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors
• Moderate to strong CYP2C19 inducers or moderate to strong CYP3A4 
inducers
Because of the risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, CAMZYOS is 
available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and 
Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called CAMZYOS REMS PROGRAM [see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.3)].
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE
CAMZYOS® is indicated for the treatment of adults with symptomatic New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) class II-III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) to improve 
functional capacity and symptoms.

2.1 Initiation, Maintenance, and Interruption of Treatment
Confirm absence of pregnancy and usage of effective contraception in females of 
reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Initiation or up-titration of CAMZYOS in patients with LVEF <55% is not recommended.
The recommended starting dose is 5 mg orally once daily without regard to food; allowable  
subsequent doses with titration are 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg orally once daily.  
The maximum recommended dose is 15 mg orally once daily.
Patients may develop heart failure while taking CAMZYOS. Regular LVEF and Valsalva left 
ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient assessment is required for careful titration to 
achieve an appropriate target Valsalva LVOT gradient, while maintaining LVEF ≥50% and 
avoiding heart failure symptoms (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).
Daily dosing takes weeks to reach steady-state drug levels and therapeutic effects, and 
genetic variation in metabolism and drug interactions can cause large differences in 
exposure [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug 
Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacolog y (12.3)].
When initiating or titrating CAMZYOS, first consider LVEF then consider the Valsalva LVOT 
gradient and patient clinical status to guide appropriate CAMZYOS dosing. Follow the 
algorithms for Initiation (Figure 1) and Maintenance (Figure 2) for appropriate CAMZYOS 
dosing and monitoring schedules.
If LVEF <50% while taking CAMZYOS, interrupt treatment. Follow the algorithm for 
Interruption (Figure 3) for guidance on interrupting, restarting, or discontinuing CAMZYOS. 
If interrupted at 2.5 mg, either restart at 2.5 mg or discontinue permanently.CAMZYOS® (mavacamten) CAMZYOS® (mavacamten)Delay dose increases when there is intercurrent illness (e.g., serious infection) or 
arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation or other uncontrolled tachyarrhythmia) that may impair 
systolic function. Consider interruption of CAMZYOS in patients with intercurrent illness 
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Missed or delayed doses
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, and the next scheduled dose 
should be taken at the usual time the following day. Exact timing of dosing during the day 
is not essential, but two doses should not be taken on the same day.
Swallow capsules whole. Do not break, open, or chew the capsules.
2.2 Concomitant Administration of Weak CYP2C19 or Moderate CYP3A4 
Inhibitors
Initiate CAMZYOS at the recommended starting dosage of 5 mg orally once daily  
in patients who are on stable therapy with a weak CYP2C19 inhibitor or a moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor.
Reduce dosage of CAMZYOS by one level (i.e., 15 mg →  10 mg; 10 mg → 5 mg; or  
5 mg → 2.5 mg) in patients who initiate a weak CYP2C19 inhibitor or a moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitor. Schedule clinical and echocardiographic assessment 4 weeks after inhibitor 
initiation, and do not up-titrate CAMZYOS until 12 weeks after inhibitor initiation. Avoid 
initiation of concomitant weak CYP2C19 and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients who 
are on stable treatment with 2.5 mg of CAMZYOS because a lower CAMZYOS once-daily 
dose is not available [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
CAMZYOS is available as capsules imprinted with the strength and “Mava” in the 
following strengths:
• 2.5 mg – light purple cap
• 5 mg – yellow cap
• 10 mg – pink cap
• 15 mg – gray cap4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
CAMZYOS is contraindicated with concomitant use of:
• Moderate to strong CYP2C19 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]
• Moderate to strong CYP2C19 inducers or moderate to strong CYP3A4 inducers 
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Heart Failure
CAMZYOS reduces systolic contraction and can cause heart failure or totally block 
ventricular function. Patients who experience a serious intercurrent illness (e.g., serious 
infection) or arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation or other uncontrolled tachyarrhythmia) 
are at greater risk of developing systolic dysfunction and heart failure [see Clinical Trial 
Experience (6.1)].
Assess the patient’s clinical status and LVEF prior to and regularly during treatment and 
adjust the CAMZYOS dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. New or 
worsening arrhythmia, dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, leg edema, or elevations 
in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) may be signs and symptoms of 
heart failure and should also prompt an evaluation of cardiac function.
Asymptomatic LVEF reduction, intercurrent illnesses, and arrhythmias require additional 
dosing considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].
Initiation of CAMZYOS in patients with LVEF <55% is not recommended. Avoid 
concomitant use of CAMZYOS in patients on disopyramide, ranolazine, verapamil with 
a beta blocker, or diltiazem with a beta blocker as these medications and combinations 
increase the risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure symptoms and 
clinical experience is limited [see Drug Interactions (7)].Figure 3: Treatment Interruption at Any Clinic Visit if LVEF <50%
1. Restart treatment at next lower 
 daily (mg) dose level.

CAMZYOS is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Concomitant use 
of CAMZYOS and drugs that interact with these enzymes may lead to life-threatening 
drug interactions such as heart failure or loss of effectiveness [see Contraindications (4), 
Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Advise patients of the potential for drug interactions, including with over-the-counter 
medications (such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, or cimetidine). Advise patients to 
inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant products prior to and during CAMZYOS 
treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].
5.3 CAMZYOS REMS Program
CAMZYOS is only available through a restricted program called the CAMZYOS REMS 
Program because of the risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].
Notable requirements of the CAMZYOS REMS Program include the following:
• Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the CAMZYOS REMS Program.
• Patients must enroll in the CAMZYOS REMS Program and comply with ongoing 
monitoring requirements [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
• Pharmacies must be certified by enrolling in the CAMZYOS REMS Program and 
must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive CAMZYOS.
• Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies.
Further information is available at www.CAMZYOSREMS.com or by telephone at 
1-833-628-7367.
5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
CAMZYOS may cause fetal toxicity when administered to a pregnant female, based on 
findings in animal studies. Confirm absence of pregnancy in females of reproductive 
potential prior to treatment and advise patients to use effective contraception during 
treatment with CAMZYOS and for 4 months after the last dose. CHCs containing a 
combination of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone may be used with mavacamten. 
However, CAMZYOS may reduce the effectiveness of certain other combined hormonal 
contraceptives (CHC). If these CHCs are used, advise patients to add nonhormonal 
contraception (such as condoms) during concomitant use and for 4 months after the last 
dose of CAMZYOS [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
The following adverse reaction is discussed in other sections of the labeling:
• Heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction 
rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the 
clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
The safety of CAMZYOS was evaluated in EXPLORER-HCM, a Phase 3, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Of the 251 adults with 
obstructive HCM, 123 patients were treated with CAMZYOS 2.5-15 mg daily and 128 were 
treated with placebo. CAMZYOS-treated patients had a median duration of exposure of 
30 weeks (range: 2-40 weeks).
Syncope (0.8%) was the only adverse drug reaction leading to discontinuation in patients 
receiving CAMZYOS.
Adverse reactions occurring in >5% of patients and more commonly on CAMZYOS than 
on placebo were dizziness (27% vs. 18%) and syncope (6% vs. 2%).
The safety of CAMZYOS in patients was further evaluated in VALOR-HCM, a Phase 3, 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Of the  
112 adults with symptomatic obstructive HCM, 56 patients were treated with CAMZYOS 
2.5-15 mg daily and 55 were treated with placebo. CAMZYOS-treated patients had a 
median duration of exposure of 17 weeks (range: 3-19 weeks).
There were no new adverse reactions identified in VALOR-HCM.
Effects on Systolic Function
In the EXPLORER-HCM trial, mean (SD) resting LVEF was 74% (6) at baseline in both 
treatment groups. Consistent with the mechanism of action of CAMZYOS, mean (SD) 
absolute change from baseline in LVEF was -4% (8) in the CAMZYOS group and 0% (7) in 
the placebo group over the 30-week treatment period. At Week 38, following an 8-week 
interruption of trial drug, mean LVEF was similar to baseline for both treatment groups. 
In the EXPLORER-HCM trial, 7 (6%) patients in the CAMZYOS group and 2 (2%) patients 
in the placebo group experienced reversible reductions in LVEF to <50% (median 48%: 
range 35-49%) while on treatment. In 3 of the 7 CAMZYOS patients and 1 of the 2 placebo 
patients, these reductions were asymptomatic. In all 7 patients treated with CAMZYOS, 
LVEF recovered following interruption of CAMZYOS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Plasma Concentrations of CAMZYOS
Mavacamten is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C9. Inducers and inhibitors of CYP2C19 and moderate to strong inhibitors or inducers 
of CYP3A4 may affect the exposures of mavacamten [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) 
and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. (See Table 1)
Table 1: Established and Potentially Significant Pharmacokinetic Drug 
Interactions with CAMZYOS
Impact of Other Drugs on CAMZYOS
Moderate to Strong CYP2C19 Inhibitors or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors
Clinical Impact Concomitant use with a moderate to strong CYP2C19 or a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor increases mavacamten exposure, which may increase the risk 
of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction [see Contraindications (4), 
Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Prevention or 
ManagementConcomitant use with a moderate to strong CYP2C19 inhibitor or a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor is contraindicated.
Moderate to Strong CYP2C19 Inducers or Moderate to Strong CYP3A4 Inducers
Clinical Impact Concomitant use with a moderate to strong CYP2C19 inducer or a 
moderate to strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases mavacamten exposure, 
which may reduce CAMZYOS’ efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  
The risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction may increase with 
discontinuation of these inducers as the levels of induced enzyme 
normalizes [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Prevention or 
ManagementConcomitant use of a moderate to strong CYP2C19 inducer or a moderate 
to strong CYP3A4 inducer is contraindicated.
Weak CYP2C19 Inhibitors or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors
Clinical Impact Concomitant use with a weak CYP2C19 inhibitor or a moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitor increases mavacamten exposure, which may increase the risk of 
adverse drug reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Prevention or 
ManagementInitiate CAMZYOS at the recommended starting dosage of 5 mg orally 
once daily in patients who are on stable therapy with a weak CYP2C19 
inhibitor or a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.
Reduce dose of CAMZYOS by one level (i.e., 15 to 10 mg, 10 to 5 mg,  
or 5 to 2.5 mg) in patients who are on CAMZYOS treatment and intend  
to initiate a weak CYP2C19 inhibitor or a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
Avoid initiation of concomitant weak CYP2C19 and moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors in patients who are on stable treatment with 2.5 mg of 
CAMZYOS because a lower dose is not available [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.2)].
7.2 Potential for CAMZYOS to Affect Plasma Concentrations of Other Drugs
Certain CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 Substrates
Mavacamten is an inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Concomitant use with 
CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates may reduce plasma concentration of these 
drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Closely monitor when CAMZYOS is used with 
concomitant CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates unless otherwise recommended in 
the Prescribing Information.
Certain Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (CHC)
Progestin and ethinyl estradiol are CYP3A4 substrates. Concomitant use of CAMZYOS 
may decrease exposures of certain progestins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which 
may lead to contraceptive failure. CHCs containing a combination of ethinyl estradiol and 
norethindrone may be used with mavacamten, but if other CHCs are used, advise patients 
to add nonhormonal contraception (such as condoms) during concomitant use and for 
4 months after the last dose of CAMZYOS.
7.3 Drugs That Reduce Cardiac Contractility
Expect additive negative inotropic effects of CAMZYOS and other drugs that reduce cardiac 
contractility. Avoid concomitant use of CAMZYOS in patients on disopyramide, ranolazine, 
verapamil with a beta blocker, or diltiazem with a beta blocker as these medications and 
combinations increase the risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure 
symptoms and clinical experience is limited [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
If concomitant therapy with a negative inotrope is initiated, or if the dose of a negative 
inotrope is increased, monitor LVEF closely until stable doses and clinical response have 
been achieved.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Risk Summary
Based on animal data, CAMZYOS may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
female. There are no human data on the use of CAMZYOS during pregnancy to evaluate 
for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal CAMZYOS® (mavacamten) CAMZYOS® (mavacamten)or fetal outcomes. The underlying maternal condition during pregnancy poses a risk to 
the mother and fetus (see Clinical Considerations) . Advise pregnant females about the 
potential risk to the fetus with maternal exposure to CAMZYOS during pregnancy.
In animal embryo-fetal development studies, mavacamten-related decreases in 
mean fetal body weight, reductions in fetal ossification of bones, and increases in 
post-implantation loss (early and/or late resorptions) were observed in rats and increases 
in visceral and skeletal malformations were observed in both rabbits and rats at dose 
exposures similar to that achieved at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) 
(see Data).
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or 
other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of 
major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 
15% to 20%, respectively.
There is a pregnancy safety study for CAMZYOS. If CAMZYOS is administered during 
pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving CAMZYOS or within 4 months 
after the last dose of CAMZYOS, healthcare providers should report CAMZYOS exposure by 
contacting Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or www.bms.com.
Clinical Considerations
Disease-Associated Maternal and Embryo-Fetal Risk
Obstructive HCM in pregnancy has been associated with increased risk for preterm birth.
Data
Animal Data
When mavacamten was administered orally to pregnant rats (0.3 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) 
during the period of organogenesis, increases in post-implantation loss, decreases in 
mean fetal body weight, reductions in fetal ossification of bones, and fetal malformations 
(visceral and skeletal) were observed in the high dose group (1.5 mg/kg/day). Visceral 
malformations (heart malformation in fetuses, including one total situs inversus) and 
increased incidences of skeletal malformations (mainly fused sternebrae) were observed 
at a similar exposure as in humans at the MRHD. Plasma exposure (based on area under 
the concentration-time curve or AUC) at the no-effect dose for embryo-fetal development 
in rats is 0.3 times the exposure in humans at the MRHD.
When mavacamten was administered orally to pregnant rabbits (0.6 to 2.0 mg/kg/day) 
during the period of organogenesis, fetal malformations (visceral and skeletal) were 
increased at doses of 1.2 mg/kg/day and higher, with similar plasma exposure at 
1.2 mg/kg/day as in humans at the MRHD. Visceral findings consisted of malformations of 
the great vessels (dilatation of pulmonary trunk and/or aortic arch). Skeletal malformations 
consisted of higher incidences of fused sternebrae at ≥1.2 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposure 
(AUC) at the no-effect dose for embryo-fetal development in rabbits is 0.4 times the 
exposure in humans at the MRHD.
In a pre/postnatal development study, mavacamten was administered orally to pregnant 
rats (0.3, to 1.5 mg/kg/day) from gestation Day 6 to lactation/post-partum Day 20. 
No adverse effects were observed in the dams or offspring exposed daily from before 
birth (in utero) through lactation. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 
1.5 mg/kg/day (the highest dosage level tested), with similar exposure (AUC) as in 
humans at the MRHD.
8.2 Lactation
Risk Summary
The presence of mavacamten in human or animal milk, the drug’s effects on the breastfed 
infant, and the effects on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health 
benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for 
CAMZYOS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CAMZYOS or from 
the underlying maternal condition.
8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
Based on animal data, CAMZYOS may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
female [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Pregnancy Testing
Confirm absence of pregnancy in females of reproductive potential prior to initiation 
of CAMZYOS.
Contraception
Females
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment 
with CAMZYOS and for 4 months after the last dose. CHCs containing a combination of 
ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone may be used with mavacamten. However, CAMZYOS 
may reduce the effectiveness of certain other combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC). 
If these CHCs are used, advise patients to add nonhormonal contraception (such as 
condoms) during concomitant use and for 4 months after the last dose of CAMZYOS  
[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].8.4 Pediatric Use
The safety and effectiveness of CAMZYOS have not been established in pediatric patients.
8.5 Geriatric Use
Clinical trials included 319 patients dosed with CAMZYOS, 1 19 of whom were 
65 years of age or older (37.3%), and 25 of whom (7.8%) were age 75 years or older.  
Safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetics were similar between patients ≥65 years  
and younger patients.
8.6 Hepatic Impairment
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate 
(Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Mavacamten exposure (AUC) increased up to 220% 
in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment 
compared to patients with normal hepatic function. However, no additional dose 
adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment with 
the recommended dose titration algorithm and monitoring plan. The effect of severe 
(Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacolog y (12.3)].
10 OVERDOSAGE
Clinical Experience and Effects
• Cardiovascular effects may include reduced LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction), 
heart failure, hypotension, and asystole refractory to medical intervention.
• Neurological effects may include dizziness and syncope.
• An infant death was reported after accidental ingestion of three 15 mg capsules 
(45 mg).
• An adult administered a single dose of 144 mg developed a vasovagal reaction, 
hypotension, and asystole, but the subject recovered.
Management
• Discontinue CAMZYOS treatment.
• Provide medically supportive measures to maintain hemodynamic stability and 
monitor left ventricular function.
• Consider administering activated charcoal (pediatric dose is 1 g/kg; adult dose  
is 50 g) within 2 hours of ingestion in addition to other supportive measures.  
The benefit of activated charcoal is negligible after 6 hours [see Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)].
• Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222- 1222) or a medical 
toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

OHN N CH3 CH3CH3
N
H
Mavacamten is a white to off-white powder that is practically insoluble in water and 
aqueous buffers at pH 2-10, sparingly soluble in methanol and ethanol, and freely soluble 
in DMSO and NMP .
CAMZYOS is supplied as immediate release Size 2 hard gelatin capsules, containing 
2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of mavacamten per capsule as active ingredient and the 
following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, magnesium stearate 
(non-bovine), mannitol, and silicon dioxide. The capsule shell contains black edible ink, 
black iron oxide, gelatin, red iron oxide, titanium dioxide, and yellow iron oxide.
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
Mavacamten is an allosteric and reversible inhibitor selective for cardiac myosin. 
Mavacamten modulates the number of myosin heads that can enter “on actin” (power- 
generating) states, thus reducing the probability of force-producing (systolic) and residual 
(diastolic) cross-bridge formation. Excess myosin actin cross-bridge formation and 
dysregulation of the super-relaxed state are mechanistic hallmarks of HCM. Mavacamten 
shifts the overall myosin population towards an energy-sparing, recruitable, super-relaxed 
state. In HCM patients, myosin inhibition with mavacamten reduces dynamic LVOT 
obstruction and improves cardiac filling pressures.
12.2 Pharmacodynamics
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction and Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction
In the EXPLORER-HCM trial, patients achieved reductions in mean resting and provoked 
(Valsalva) LVOT gradient by Week 4 which were sustained throughout the 30-week 
trial. At Week 30, the mean (SD) changes from baseline in resting and Valsalva LVOT 
gradients were -39 (29) mmHg and -49 (34) mmHg, respectively, for the CAMZYOS group  CAMZYOS® (mavacamten) CAMZYOS® (mavacamten)and -6 (28) mmHg and -12 (31) mmHg, respectively, for the placebo group. The reductions 
in Valsalva LVOT gradient were accompanied by decreases in LVEF, generally within  
the normal range. Eight weeks after discontinuation of CAMZYOS, mean LVEF and  
Valsalva LVOT gradients were similar to baseline.
Cardiac Structure
In EXPLORER-HCM, echocardiographic measurements of cardiac structure showed a 
mean (SD) reduction from baseline at Week 30 in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in  
the mavacamten group (-7.4 [17.8] g/m2) versus an increase in LVMI in the placebo  
group (8.9 [15.3] g/m2). There was also a mean (SD) reduction from baseline in left  
atrial volume index (LAVI) in the mavacamten group (-7.5 [7.8] mL/m2) versus no change 
in the placebo group (-0.1 [8.7] mL/m2). The clinical significance of these findings 
is unknown.
Cardiac Biomarkers
In the EXPLORER-HCM trial [see Clinical Studies (14)], reductions in a biomarker of 
cardiac wall stress, NT-proBNP , were observed by Week 4 and sustained through the 
end of treatment. At Week 30 compared with baseline, the reduction in NT-proBNP after 
mavacamten treatment was 80% greater than for placebo (proportion of geometric mean 
ratio between the two groups, 0.20 [95% CI: 0.17, 0.24]). 
In the VALOR-HCM trial [see Clinical Studies (14)], a reduction in NT-proBNP was observed 
by Week 8 and sustained throughout treatment. At Week 16 compared with baseline, the 
reduction in NT-proBNP after mavacamten treatment was 67% greater than for placebo 
(proportion of geometric mean ratio between the two groups, 0.33 [95% CI: 0.27, 0.42]). 
At Week 16 compared with baseline, a reduction in cardiac troponin I after mavacamten 
treatment was 47% greater than for placebo (proportion of geometric mean ratio between 
the two groups, 0.53 [95% CI: 0.41, 0.70]).
The clinical significance of the NT-proBNP and troponin findings is unknown.
Cardiac Electrophysiology
In healthy volunteers receiving multiple doses of CAMZYOS, a concentration-dependent 
increase in the QTc interval was observed at doses up to 25 mg once daily. No acute 
QTc changes have been observed at similar exposures during single-dose studies.  
The mechanism of the QT prolongation effect is not known.
A meta-analysis across clinical studies in HCM patients does not suggest clinically 
relevant increases in the QTc interval in the therapeutic exposure range. In HCM, the 
QT interval may be intrinsically prolonged due to the underlying disease, in association 
with ventricular pacing, or in association with drugs with potential for QT prolongation 
commonly used in the HCM population. The effect of coadministration of CAMZYOS with 
other QT-prolonging drugs or in patients with potassium channel variants resulting in a 
long QT interval have not been characterized.
12.3 Pharmacokinetics
Mavacamten exposure increases dose proportionally following multiple once-daily 
doses of 1 mg to 15 mg. At the same dose level of CAMZYOS, 170% higher exposures 
of mavacamten are observed in patients with HCM compared to healthy subjects. 
Mavacamten accumulation is approximately 100% for C max and approximately 600% 
for AUC in CYP2C19 normal metabolizers (NMs). The accumulation is dependent upon 
the CYP2C19 metabolism status with the largest accumulation occurring in CYP2C19 
poor metabolizers (PMs). At steady-state, the peak-to-trough mavacamten plasma 
concentration ratio with once daily dosing is approximately 1.5.
Absorption
Mavacamten has an estimated oral bioavailability of at least 85% and median time to 
maximum concentration (T max) of 1 to 2 hours.
Effect of Food
No clinically significant differences in mavacamten AUC were observed following its 
administration with a high fat meal.
Distribution
Plasma protein binding of mavacamten is between 97 and 98%.
Elimination
Mavacamten has a variable terminal t 1/2 that depends on CYP2C19 metabolic status. 
Mavacamten terminal half-life is 6 to 9 days in CYP2C19 normal metabolizers (NMs), 
which is prolonged in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PMs) to 23 days.
Metabolism
Mavacamten is extensively metabolized, primarily through CYP2C19 (74%), CYP3A4 (18%),  
and CYP2C9 (8%).
Excretion
Following a single 25 mg dose of radiolabeled mavacamten, 7% of the dose was recovered  
in feces (1% unchanged) and 85% in urine (3% unchanged).
Specific Populations
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of mavacamten were 
observed based on age (range: 18-82 years), sex, race, ethnicity, or mild (eGFR: 60 to 
89 mL/min/1.73 m2) to moderate (eGFR: 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment.  The effects of severe (eGFR: 15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment and kidney 
failure (eGFR: <15 mL/min/1.73 m2; including patients on dialysis) are unknown.
Hepatic Impairment
Mavacamten exposures (AUC) increased up to 220% in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A)  
or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. The effect of severe (Child-Pugh C) 
hepatic impairment is unknown.
Drug Interactions
Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches
Weak CYP2C19 Inhibitors: Concomitant use of mavacamten (15 mg) with omeprazole 
(20 mg) once daily increased mavacamten AUC inf by 48% with no effect on C max in healthy 
CYP2C19 NMs and rapid metabolizers (RMs; e.g., *1/*17).
Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Concomitant use of mavacamten (25 mg) with verapamil 
sustained release (240 mg) increased mavacamten AUC inf by 16% and C max by 52% in 
intermediate metabolizers (IMs; e.g., *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*17, *3/*17) and NMs of CYP2C19. 
Concomitant use of mavacamten with diltiazem in CYP2C19 PMs is predicted to increase 
mavacamten AUC 0-24h and C max up to 55% and 42%, respectively.
Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Concomitant use of mavacamten (15 mg) with ketoconazole 
400 mg once daily is predicted to increase mavacamten AUC 0-24 and C max up to 130% 
and 90%, respectively.
Strong CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 Inducers: Concomitant use of mavacamten (a single 
15 mg dose) with a strong CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin 600 mg daily dose)  
is predicted to decrease mavacamten AUC 0-inf and C max by 87% and 22%, respectively,  
in CYP2C19 NMs, and by 69% and 4%, respectively, in CYP2C19 PMs.
CYP3A4 Substrates: Concomitant use of a 16-day course of mavacamten (25 mg on days 
1 and 2, followed by 15 mg for 14 days) decreased AUC inf and C max of midazolam by 13% 
and 7%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Following coadministration of mavacamten once 
daily in HCM patients at the upper end of the therapeutic range, midazolam AUC inf and 
Cmax are predicted to decrease up to 45% and 24%, respectively.
Certain combined oral contraceptives: No clinically significant differences in ethinyl 
estradiol and norethindrone exposure were observed in healthy female subjects with 
CYP2C19 NM phenotype following concomitant use of a combined oral contraceptive 
containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone with a 17-day course of mavacamten 
(25 mg on days 1 and 2, followed by 15 mg for 15 days). The impact of mavacamten on 
oral contraceptives containing other progestins is unknown.
CYP2C8 Substrates: Concomitant use of mavacamten once daily in HCM patients is 
predicted to decrease AUC and C max of repaglinide, a CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrate, by 
up to 27% and 19%, respectively, depending on the dose of mavacamten and CYP2C19 
phenotype.
CYP2C9 Substrates: Concomitant use of mavacamten once daily in HCM patients is 
predicted to decrease AUC and C max of tolbutamide, a CYP2C9 substrate, by up to 54% 
and 23%, respectively, depending on the dose of mavacamten and CYP2C19 phenotype.
CYP2C19 Substrates: Concomitant use of mavacamten once daily in HCM patients is 
predicted to decrease AUC and C max of omeprazole, a CYP2C19 substrate, by up to 48% 
and 17%, respectively, depending on the dose of mavacamten and CYP2C19 phenotype.
Activated Charcoal: Mavacamten AUC 0-72h and AUC 0-infinity  was reduced by 14% and  
34%, respectively, following administration of 50 g activated charcoal with sorbitol 2 hours 
after ingestion of a single mavacamten 15 mg dose. Administration of activated charcoal 
6 hours after the mavacamten dose had minimal effect on mavacamten exposure.
In Vitro Studies
CYP Enzymes: Mavacamten does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, or CYP3A4. Mavacamten is a CYP2B6 inducer.
Transporter Systems: Mavacamten does not inhibit P-gp, BCRP , BSEP , MATE1, MATE2-K, 
organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs), organic cation transporters (OCTs), or 
organic anion transporters (OATs).
12.5 Pharmacogenomics
Mavacamten AUC inf increased by 241% and C max increased by 47% in CYP2C19 poor 
metabolizers (PMs) compared to normal metabolizers (NMs) following a single dose of 
15 mg mavacamten. Mean half-life is prolonged in CYP2C19 PMs compared to NMs 
(23 days vs. 6 to 9 days, respectively).
Polymorphic CYP2C19 is the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of CAMZYOS.  
An individual carrying two normal function alleles is a NM (e.g., *1/*1). An individual 
carrying two no function alleles is a PM (e.g., *2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3).
The prevalence of CYP2C19 poor metabolizers differs depending on ancestry. 
Approximately 2% of individuals of European ancestry and 4% of individuals of 
African ancestry are PMs; the prevalence of PMs is higher in Asian populations (e.g., 
approximately 13% of East Asians).

Endpoint / N of Pa tients (%)There was no evidence of carcinogenicity seen in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse 
study at mavacamten doses of up to 2.0 mg/kg/day in males and 3.0 mg/kg/day 
in females, or in a 2-year rat study at mavacamten doses up to 0.6 mg/kg/day. The 
exposure-based (AUC) safety margins in mice and rats were up to 3X or 0.2X, respectively, 
compared to AUC exposures in humans at the MRHD.
In reproductive toxicity studies, there was no evidence of effects of mavacamten on 
mating and fertility in male or female rats at doses up to 1.2 mg/kg/day, or on the viability 
and fertility of offspring of dams dosed up to 1.5 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposure (AUC) of 
mavacamten at the highest dose tested was the same as in humans at the MRHD.
13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology
The safety of mavacamten has been evaluated in rats and dogs at multiple dose levels 
(0.06 to 10 mg/kg/day) orally. Noted toxicities, including echocardiographic findings, 
reduction in systolic function, cardiac dilation, and death, as well as increased heart 
weights in rats, were consistent with mavacamten’s mechanism of action and primary 
pharmacological activity. Other findings included cardiac osseous metaplasia in rats and 
QTc prolongation in dogs. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the NOAEL in rats and dogs were 
0.1 and 0.3 times, respectively, human exposure (AUC) at the MRHD.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
EXPLORER-HCM
The efficacy of CAMZYOS was evaluated in EXPLORER-HCM (NCT-03470545) a Phase 3, 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group 
trial in 251 adults with symptomatic NYHA class II and III obstructive HCM, LVEF ≥55%, 
and LVOT peak gradient ≥50 mmHg at rest or with provocation.
Patients on dual therapy with beta blocker and calcium channel blocker treatment or 
monotherapy with disopyramide or ranolazine were excluded. Patients with a known 
infiltrative or storage disorder causing cardiac hypertrophy that mimicked obstructive 
HCM, such as Fabry disease, amyloidosis, or Noonan syndrome with left ventricular 
hypertrophy, were also excluded.
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a starting dose of 5 mg of 
CAMZYOS or placebo once daily for 30 weeks. Treatment assignment was stratified by 
baseline NYHA functional class, baseline use of beta blockers, and type of ergometer 
(treadmill or exercise bicycle).
Groups were well matched with respect to age (mean 59 years), BMI (mean 30 kg/m2),  
heart rate (mean 62 bpm), blood pressure (mean 128/76 mmHg), and race (90% 
Caucasian). Males comprised 54% of the CAMZYOS group and 65% of the placebo group.
At baseline, approximately 73% of the randomized patients were NYHA class II and 27% were NYHA class III. The mean LVEF was 74%, and the mean Valsalva LVOT gradient was 
73 mmHg. About 10% had prior septal reduction therapy, 75% were on beta blockers, 
17% were on calcium channel blockers, and 14% had a history of atrial fibrillation.
All patients were initiated on CAMZYOS 5 mg (or matching placebo) once daily, and the 
dose was periodically adjusted to optimize patient response (decrease in LVOT gradient 
with Valsalva maneuver) and maintain LVEF ≥50%. The dose was also informed by plasma 
concentrations of CAMZYOS.
In the CAMZYOS group, at the end of treatment, 49% of patients were receiving the 
5-mg dose, 33% were receiving the 10-mg dose, and 11% were receiving the 15-mg 
dose. Three patients temporarily interrupted their dose due to LVEF <50%, of whom two 
resumed treatment at the same dose and one had the dose reduced from 10 mg to 5 mg.
Primary endpoint
The primary composite functional endpoint, assessed at 30 weeks, was defined as the 
proportion of patients who achieved either improvement of peak oxygen consumption 
(pVO 2) by ≥1.5 mL/kg/min plus improvement in NYHA class by at least 1 or improvement 
of pVO 2 by ≥3.0 mL/kg/min plus no worsening in NYHA class.
A greater proportion of patients met the primary endpoint at Week 30 in the CAMZYOS 
group compared to the placebo group (37% vs. 17%, respectively, p=0.0005; see Table 2).

primary analysis consistently favored CAMZYOS across all subgroups analyzed (Figure 4).
The dashed vertical line represents the overall treatment effect and the solid vertical line (no effect) 
indicates no difference between treatment groups.
Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups, all of which are baseline characteristics. 
The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account the number of comparisons made 
and may not reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent 
homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted.CAMZYOS® (mavacamten) CAMZYOS® (mavacamten)Although the benefit of mavacamten was smaller in patients on background beta blocker 
therapy compared to those who were not (attenuated improvement in pVO 2), analyses of 
other secondary endpoints (symptoms, LVOT gradient) suggest that patients might benefit 
from mavacamten treatment regardless of beta blocker use.
Secondary endpoints
The treatment effects of CAMZYOS on LVOT obstruction, functional capacity, and health 
status were assessed by change from baseline through Week 30 in post-exercise LVOT 
peak gradient, change in pVO 2, proportion of patients with improvement in NYHA class, 
Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-23 (KCCQ-23) Clinical Summary Score (CSS), 
and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Symptom Questionnaire (HCMSQ) Shortness of Breath 
(SoB) domain score. At Week 30, patients receiving CAMZYOS had greater improvement 
compared to the placebo group across all secondary endpoints (Table 3, Figure 5, 
Figure 6, Table 4, and Figures 7-10).

VALOR-HCM
The efficacy of CAMZYOS was evaluated in VALOR-HCM, a Phase 3, double-blind, 
randomized, 16-week placebo-controlled trial in 112 patients (mean age of 60 years; 
51% men; 93% ≥ NYHA class III) randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with CAMZYOS or 
placebo. At baseline, all patients had symptomatic obstructive HCM and were SRT eligible. 
Patients with severely symptomatic drug-refractory obstructive HCM (including 33% on 
any combination of beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker and/or disopyramide; 20% 
were on disopyramide alone or in combination with other treatment), and NYHA class III/IV  
or class II with exertional syncope or near syncope, were included in the study. Patients 
were required to have LVOT peak gradient ≥50 mmHg at rest or with provocation, and 
LVEF ≥60%. Patients must have been referred or under active consideration within the 
past 12 months for SRT and actively considering scheduling the procedure.
Patients received CAMZYOS (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or a placebo capsule once 
daily for 16 weeks. Dose adjustment was based on clinical echocardiogram parameters.
Primary endpoint
CAMZYOS was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing the proportion of patients who 
met the primary endpoint (the composite of patient decision to proceed with SRT prior to 
or at Week 16 or met SRT eligibility (LVOT gradient of ≥50 mmHg and NYHA class III-IV, or 
class II with exertional syncope or near syncope) at Week 16 (18% vs. 77%, respectively, 
p<0.0001; see Table 5).

Secondary endpoints
The treatment effects of CAMZYOS on LVOT obstruction, functional capacity, and health 
status were assessed by change from baseline through Week 16 in post-exercise LVOT 
gradient, proportion of patients with improvement in NYHA class, and KCCQ-23 CSS.
